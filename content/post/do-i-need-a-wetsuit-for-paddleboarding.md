## Why do we need wetsuits for paddleboarding?

A lot of people ask me the question do I need a wetsuit for paddleboarding? In this article, I will share the reason why I think wetsuits are generally a good option for paddleboarding.

So first a quick introduction:  Wetsuits trap a layer of water between your skin and the neoprene, keeping you warm and comfortable in water that might otherwise be too chilly. This makes wetsuits great for swimming, surfing, SUP, water skiing, kayaking, fishing, snorkelling, diving, and sailing, to name a few!

You can find wetsuits in various thicknesses to suit your needs, ranging from very thin and flexible to extra-thick and snug.

Most wetsuits are made of neoprene, which is naturally insulating and helps keep water out, so these suits keep you warm both in and out of the water. Wetsuits are great for swimmers, divers, and water sports enthusiasts who want to stay warm and enjoy protection from the elements.

A wetsuit will keep water out of your suit thanks to its neoprene material and will keep you warm as well thanks to its insulating properties. You can also choose a wetsuit with sleeves to keep your arms warm as well.

Wetsuits come in many different styles and designs, so you can pick the one that suits you best. Wetsuits are a good choice for any water temperature.

**There are three main types of materials used to make wetsuits: standard (neoprene), semi-solid, and solid.**

While **standard neoprene** is the most affordable, it is also the least warm.

**Semi-solid neoprenes** are a little bit warmer than standard neoprenes but more expensive than standard neoprenes.

**Solid neoprenes** are the warmest, but also the most expensive.

The easiest and quickest way to dry your wetsuit is to hang it up somewhere warm and dry. It will dry within a day or two, and will quickly be ready to use again. Many divers also choose to rinse their wetsuits out with fresh water after every dive. This will help to prevent salt buildup and also leave it smelling fresh.

One of the best ways to extend the life of a wetsuit is to make sure that you do not store it folded up.

Ideally, it should be hung up and allowed to air out. If you do not have space to hang it up, then at least leave it open and flat so that it can air out.

> **Pro Tip:** It is a good idea to allow your wetsuit to air out every time you use it.

Waterproof jackets are usually heavier and more expensive. The best option is a quick-drying material like nylon or polyester. It is also a good idea to purchase a jacket with a hood. A hood will keep your head dry in the event of inclement weather.

If you have a wetsuit, you will have to take off your pants and change your shorts.

You can also wash them in the washing machine on the clothes dryer. This way you do not get wet in the water or get it stuck in your wetsuit. In this case, it is better to take off your wetsuit and take your shorts before you go out at night. This will prevent water from getting into your clothes.

The reason for wearing a wetsuit when going out at night is that it keeps you warm during the night and helps keep you cool during the day.

The temperature of the water will be lower than on land and this means that even if you are wearing shorts, they will not feel so tight. On land they always feel so tight because of their shortness, because there is no insulation between skin and skin which means that they can feel cold even if they are only wearing short pants or short underwear!

If you are going out in the evening then make sure that you wear your wetsuit. You will be warmer in the evening and if you are planning on going out at all times then it is very important that you wear the wetsuit. There is no point in wearing shorts just because they feel so tight or uncomfortable!

When you come back from a dive, you have spent hours in the water, absorbing salt, and the fabric of your suit has become a sponge. When you take the suit off, you are left with a soggy, wet piece of clothing that retains water like a sponge.

## What can you do?

There are a few different options here, but the most popular option is to wear a pair of water shoes while you are putting your suit on.

## What are water shoes?

They are shoes that have been designed with a cloth or synthetic upper that will not become waterlogged when they come into contact with water. They are designed to keep your feet dry and warm.

Our skin cells may absorb water, resulting in cold feet and poor health. When we finally get cold feet, we have to change our clothes again! When we get in the water, we won't be able to enjoy ourselves at all.

## Then vs Now

When I was a child I used to go swimming in the sea every morning before it got too dark for us to swim without a wetsuit, and then I would change my clothes and sit on the beach with the other kids.  I used to catch so many colds back then.

Don't be me!  Nowadays you can buy a wetsuit that is not only waterproof but also breathable and therefore you can get warm without getting cold or catching a cold. The wetsuit is also much lighter than when we were children and therefore you don't have to worry about getting wet feet again.

With all of these tips, I hope that this article has helped your friend or family member who is wearing one of these wetsuits become a more comfortable and safe wearer of the wetsuit!
