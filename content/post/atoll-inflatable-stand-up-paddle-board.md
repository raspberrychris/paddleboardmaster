If you have a look at this paddle board you may not notice straight away that it is actually 40% lighter than most of the competitor boards out there.

Another great this about this paddle board is that it comes in a range of colours so even if the Aqua Marine Vibes arenâ€™t quite right for you (We LOVE this colour though!) you can check out the other colour variations.

The Atoll weighs 19 pounds, compared the the Funwater Paddle Board that weighs 27 pounds, this is a lot easier to  carry around.  If you are looking for a paddle board that is easy to transport, lightweight and has a fantastic design with everything included then you could be interested in the Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board
