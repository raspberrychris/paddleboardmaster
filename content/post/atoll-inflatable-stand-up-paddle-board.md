If you have a look at this paddle board you may not notice straight away that it is actually 40% lighter than most of the competitor boards out there.  This is one of the hidden features about this paddle board!

Thank you for joining us in this review of the Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board. In this review we will be looking at the pros and cons of this paddle board and also comparing it against competitor paddle boards to understand exactly how it performs and whether it offers real value for money.

The Atoll Inflatable stand up paddle board comes in a range of colours so even if the Aqua Marine Vibes arenâ€™t quite right for you (We LOVE this colour though!) you can check out the other colour variations.

Atoll have 4 colors for this paddle board: Aqua Marine (Pictured), Desert Sand, Green and Blue.  All the color variations are actually fantastic and we think Atoll has really paid close attention to the design and the colours of this paddle board.

The Atoll weighs 19 pounds, compared the the Funwater Paddle Board which we also reviewed **here**,that weighs 27 pounds, this is a lot easier to  carry around!  

If you are looking for a paddle board that is easy to transport, lightweight and has a fantastic design with everything included then you will be interested in the Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board!
