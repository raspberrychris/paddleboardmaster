Thank you for joining us in this review of the **Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board**. In this review we will be looking at the pros and cons of this paddle board and also comparing it against competitor paddle boards to understand exactly how it performs and whether it offers real value for money, for you, our loyal readers!

If you have a quick look at this paddle board, you may not be able to tell straight away that it is actually 40% lighter than most of the competitor boards out there.

This is obviously going to benefit you if you are keen to have a paddle board but want something that is easy to carry around and transport to and from the beach.

This is one of the ‘hidden’ not immediately obvious features about this paddle board!  If you like what you see  keep on scrolling down!

The [**Atoll**](/categories/atoll/) Inflatable stand up paddle board comes in a range of colours so even if the Aqua Marine Vibes aren’t quite right for you (We **LOVE** this colour though!) you can check out the other colour variations below:

[**Atoll**](/categories/atoll/) have 4 colors for this paddle board: Aqua Marine (Pictured), Desert Sand, Green and Blue.  All the color variations are actually fantastic and we think [**Atoll**](/categories/atoll/) has really paid close attention to the design and the colours of this paddle board.

The [**Atoll paddle board**](/categories/atoll/) weighs 19 pounds, compared the the [**Funwater Paddle Board which we also reviewed here**](https://paddleboardmaster.com/post/funwater-stand-up-paddle-board/), that weighs 27 pounds, this is a lot easier to carry around!  (We know which we would rather be carrying on long walks to the beach!)

If you are looking for a paddle board that is easy to transport, lightweight and has a fantastic design with everything included then you will be interested in the Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board!

## Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

This is a great all round paddle board package from Atoll.  You get all the essentials you need included straight out of the package: Paddle, Fin, a newly designed Leash, high pressure Pump and stylish travel backpack are all included.  What is there not to like here!

The included pump is a decent quality high pressure pump as well so you can get the inflation done in no time.  A lot of competitors will sometimes cut costs on the pump if they include it, but this doesn’t seem to be the case with the Atoll Inflatable Paddle Board.

Atoll say that the board is perfect for Fishing, Surfing, Meditation and Exploring and we would agree with this, with it being a lighter board than some of its competitors, but still retaining the rigidity you require for these types of activities.

Even if you are at all worried about possible damage to the paddle board, you will be pleased to know that the Atoll Inflatable Paddle Board also comes with a two year manufacturers warranty for complete peace of mind.

So who is this paddle board for? We would say if you are looking for something that is a cut above the rest, and you are not completely new to paddle boarding then you will enjoy the Atoll Inflatable Paddle Board.  This paddle board would likely suit someone of an intermediate paddle boarding level in our opinion.   Activities such as surfing with the Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle board are possible, but not extremely easy to do.  It will take a bit of practice to get up to scratch with this board if you are a complete beginner to paddle boarding.

###### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

It is great for a wide range of activities and is mostly suitable for intermediate paddle board users in our opinion.

The weight of the paddle board itself is obviously a key selling point here for this paddle board which makes it an absolute breeze to transport, making your life a lot easier when you are looking to relax and unwind.

The included accessories with this paddle board are really high quality and the high pressure pump in particular means that you can get set up in around 15 minutes, which is fast!

If you don’t want to be hanging around beach side while everyone is making the most of the water then this is definitely the paddle board for you.

In terms of the design we really appreciate the simple but purposeful design of the Atoll, the back pack as well is sturdy and made of thick material.

The icing on the cake is the 2 years manufacturers guarantee which will give you peace of mind if you are in any doubt about the quality of the board.

If you are looking for a sturdy and well designed, light paddle board, then you will love this paddle board!
