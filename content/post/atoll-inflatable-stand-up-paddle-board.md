Thank you for joining us in this review of the Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board. In this review we will be looking at the pros and cons of this paddle board and also comparing it against competitor paddle boards to understand exactly how it performs and whether it offers real value for money.

If you have a look at this paddle board you may not notice straight away that it is actually 40% lighter than most of the competitor boards out there.  

This is one of the ‘hidden’ not immediately obvious features about this paddle board!

The Atoll Inflatable stand up paddle board comes in a range of colours so even if the Aqua Marine Vibes aren’t quite right for you (We **LOVE** this colour though!) you can check out the other colour variations on Amazon.com

**Atoll** have 4 colors for this paddle board: Aqua Marine (Pictured), Desert Sand, Green and Blue.  All the color variations are actually fantastic and we think **Atoll** has really paid close attention to the design and the colours of this paddle board.

The Atoll paddle board weighs 19 pounds, compared the the Funwater Paddle Board which we also reviewed **here**, that weighs 27 pounds, this is a lot easier to carry around!  (We know which we would rather be carrying on long walks to the beach!)

If you are looking for a paddle board that is easy to transport, lightweight and has a fantastic design with everything included then you will be interested in the Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board!

## Atoll Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

This is a great all round paddle board package from Atoll.  You get all the essentials you need included straight out of the package: Paddle, Fin, Leash, Pump and travel backpack are all included.  

The included pump is a decent quality high pressure pump as well so you can get the inflation done in no time.  A lot of competitors will sometimes cut costs on the pump if they include it, but this doesn’t seem to be the case with the Atoll Inflatable Paddle Board.

Atoll say that the board is perfect for Fishing, Surfing, Meditation and Exploring and we would agree with this, with it being a lighter board
