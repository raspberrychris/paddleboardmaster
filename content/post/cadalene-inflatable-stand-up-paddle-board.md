If you are after a SUP that is super easy to get started with and comes with all the accessories included and is one of the most light and portable SUPs out there, then we think you will like this board.  It is why we gave it 5 stars.

The [**Cadalene**](#) is great for beginners and experts alike and  is made of high quality materials.

I really like the design of the board as well it is the right balance of minimalism with functional design as well.

I think the only improvement that I could suggest would be if it came with an electric pump.  Other than that this is a fantastic all rounder that isn’t going to break the bank (…or your back carrying it, as it is so light)!
