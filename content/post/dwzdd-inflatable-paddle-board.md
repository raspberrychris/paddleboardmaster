In this post I will be taking a look at the [**Dwzdd Inflatable Paddle Board**](#)**.**  Dwzdd is not a typo, I havenâ€™t just mashed the keyboard!  

They appear to be a relatively new brand to the paddleboard scene. 

In terms of the affordability of this board, straight away you feel like you are getting a good deal.

The brand in general has got a lot of positive feedback so far.  They seem to have two product lines, Gymastic tumbling mats and this particular line of inflatable paddleboard boards.  

It goes without saying that a Gymnastic tumble mat is something that you would demand a high level of durability from, so it is interesting to see whether this follows through into their inflatable SUPs.
