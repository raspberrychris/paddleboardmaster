## More about the product

### Active Cooling System

**The OutdoorMaster 20PSI High Pressure SUP Air Pump THE SHARK** has a great feature that keeps it cool while you're inflating your SUP, boat, or other inflatable â€“ the **Active Cooling System**. 

It's like having a personal air conditioner working for you â€“ but without the high energy bills! 

This system actively cools your pump while you're using it, ensuring your pump doesn't overheat. This is especially important when you're inflating bigger items like boats and SUPs.

It's no joke that the **Active Cooling System** is an important feature â€“ if your pump overheats, you won't be able to inflate your items. The Active Cooling System works by:

- Drawing in cool air from the outside environment
- Circulating it inside the pump.

This helps to keep the pump components cool, ensuring optimal performance.

**Pro Tip:** Make sure to keep the *Active Cooling System clean* of dust and debris to ensure optimal performance.

### Fast & Powerful Dual Stage Pump

**The OutdoorMaster 20PSI High Pressure SUP Air Pump THE SHARK** is equipped with an amazing feature, the fast and powerful **dual stage pump**. 

This feature is super important for anyone who uses inflatable stand up paddle boards, boats and other inflatables. 

It's like having *two pumps in one!* 

First, you get an incredibly fast inflation with the **high-pressure first stage**, then the **second stage kicks in** with a **high-volume of air** for a quick and easy inflation. It's like having two friends inflate your board or boat at the same time.

But, the fun doesn't stop there! The dual stage pump also has an *auto-off feature* to make sure you don't over-inflate your board. It's like having a built-in safety guard â€“ it senses when the item is fully inflated and turns itself off. Pretty cool, right?

But how does it work? 

Well, the dual stage pump is powered by a **12V DC car connector**. It has a **high-pressure first stage** and a **high-volume second stage**. 

The first stage is designed to *quickly and efficiently inflate* your board or boat, while the second stage kicks in to finish the job. 

The *auto-off feature* is triggered when the air pressure reaches the desired level and will shut off the pump automatically.

***Pro Tip:** Make sure to check the desired air pressure before using the dual stage pump and adjust it accordingly to ensure your board or boat is properly inflated.*
