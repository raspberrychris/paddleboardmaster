## Fitwave Paddle Board 9.5ft/10ft/11ft SUP + Kit

I am taking a look at the [**Fitwave inflatable paddleboard**](#) in this post.  When the weather is great and you want to get into exploring the great outdoors, there really is no better way to do it than by using a paddleboard in my experience.  

This paddleboard from Fitwave has been extremely popular in 2022 so far and I think that this is because it combines a huge amount of features into to one package that we think you will love. 

…(And won’t break the bank!)

Without further ado, lets take a look at the Fitwave Inflatable paddle board features!
