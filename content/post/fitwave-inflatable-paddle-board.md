## Fitwave Paddle Board 9.5ft/10ft/11ft SUP + Kit

In this post I am taking a look at the [**Fitwave inflatable paddleboard**](https://www.amazon.com/FITWAVE-Paddle-Board-10x32x6-Premium/dp/B08YFKFH46?pd_rd_i=B09SZCCBP7&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=paddleboardmaster-20&linkId=6946e160cd1663aa3b5b5869f158fb24&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), which a lot of you have recommended that I review!  

Picture the scene: When the weather is great and you want to get into exploring the great outdoors, there really is no better way to do it than by using a paddleboard in my experience!

But _which_ Paddleboard?

This paddleboard from Fitwave has been extremely popular in 2022 so far and I think that this is because it combines a huge amount of features into to one package that we think you will love. 

…(And won’t break the bank!)

Without further ado, lets take a look at the Fitwave Inflatable paddle board features!

## Features of the Fitwave

![Features-fitwave-paddleboard](/uploads/65615bd2-59b9-404f-8e2d-546a3faa6867.jpeg "Features-fitwave-paddleboard")

This is a paddleboard with a lot of great features, but its key features are that it is ultra lightweight (19lbs), wide, premium build quality and it is very stable.  It also has an anti-leaking air feature, triple bottom fans and an anti-slip surface, which makes it good for activities such as fishing, yoga and general paddling, where you need a bit more stability.

The board can support a weight of up to 242lbs, so that should be more than enough for most users of the paddleboard.

As this Fitwave paddleboard is also inflatable it makes it perfect to pack away and transport.  

### Accessories Included with the Fitwave Inflatable Paddleboard

![Fitwave-accesories](/uploads/865dbc01-60bd-4d21-9919-8493ee02d8b5.jpeg "Fitwave-accesories")

A lot of paddleboards in the market come with a few accessories, but you really do get the whole pack with this paddleboard from Fitwave.

> Everything you need to get started is included here, and I found that all of the included accessories were really good quality and well designed.  

You even get accesories such as a waterproof phone case and a floating sunglasses strap - accessories that you definitely do not see included with every paddleboard!

* Spacious Backpack
* Adjustable-length Aluminium Paddle
* Coiled Ankle Leash
* Dual-action Hand Pump & Valve Tool
* Waterproof Phone Case
* Floating Sunglasses Strap
* Double Clip Hoops
* Waterproof Repair Kit

## Our Verdict

### 5/5

### Pros:

* The accessories are fantastic and offer great value for money
* Accessories again… you get useful accessories bundled
* Wide anti-slip surface is perfect for Yoga or Fishing, where you require a wider board

  ### Cons:


* Maybe could support more weight
* Color scheme may not be to everyone’s taste

In my opinion this really is a fantastic value board that is great for beginners who are just starting out.

Unlike some other paddleboards out there you get a lot of actually useful accessories bundled in here and that is really what gives it the edge on some of the other boards that we have reviewed.

Fitwave were not content with just making a board with the basics, they have gone over and above here to give you a great first paddleboarding experience throwing in extras that you didn’t even need you needed.

And they do make a difference!

I would recommend this paddleboard from Fitwave to many different types of people - and that is what makes it so versatile really.  Where Yoga or Fishing is your jam or you just want to explore the countryside, this paddleboard could make your perfect first choice.
