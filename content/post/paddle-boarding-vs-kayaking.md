If you can't decide on whether you want to start paddle boarding or kayaking, then this blog post will help you make that decision.

In this post I will provide the arguments for and against paddleboards and kayaks, so you can make your own decision about which one you would like to pursue as your new hobby. (Who knows, maybe you'll choose both!)

If you are unfamiliar of the differences between Kayaks and paddleboards, don't worry, I've got you covered. I will run through the differences right now.

## So what are the key differences between Kayaks and Paddleboards?

The most obvious difference between the two vessels is the hollow body of the kayak which you sit in, compared to the more traditional solid body (or sometimes inflatable) of the paddle board which you typically stand on.

This is likely to be the key deciding factor for most people as the paddleboard straight away offers more options for movement than the kayak’s single seating position.

With a Kayak you sit within in it with legs stretched out in front of you, but with a Paddleboard you can lie, sit, stand or whatever you want to do on the board itself. (Some people also try Yoga on their SUPs!)

If you are the type of person that likes to move around and change position a lot, a paddleboard may be a better choice for you than a kayak.  (After all, you can’t do Yoga in a Kayak that easily)!

It seems clear that the paddleboard offers more options in terms of changing position on the vessel, but how does it compare in terms of one of they key accessories: the paddles?

### The Paddles are different for Kayaks and Paddleboards

As we have already alluded to, one of the other key physical differences between Kayaks and Paddleboards comes in the form of the paddle.  

With a Kayak you have a double ended dual blade paddle.

With a paddleboard it is a much simpler affair with one longer single blade paddle.

### Are Kayaks or Paddleboard fast? Which one is the fastest?

Most people would agree that kayaks outperform paddleboards in many situations in terms of speed.  This is not to say that paddleboards are slow, it’s an indication that if you are looking for speed on its own then a paddleboard may not be the best choice for you.

With a Kayak you can expect to get up to 2.6 knots (2-3mph).  With a paddleboard you can expect to get up 3-4  knots (around 3 mph)

### Which is faster to learn? Kayaking or Paddleboarding?

You can pick up both Kayaking and paddleboarding in a few hours of training.  Both are relatively easy to pick up and once you know the basics then you just have to learn to apply it on the water.  Paddleboarding may take a little longer to learn for some people if they wish to do other activities on the board such as Yoga, Fishing or they want to change from a sitting position to standing regularly.  As you don.

## Why do People like SUPs?

### Mobility and freedom to move around

Some people like a SUP for their the mobility.  For example if you can't sit for long periods of time then you may find a Kayak is not the right choice for you, in this way the Paddleboard wins every time, if you want to move about them.

## Why do people like Kayaks?

With a Kayak you do get a certain degree of storage space.

Most kayaks (but not all) provide considerably more storage than paddleboards.
