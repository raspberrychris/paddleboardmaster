If you can't decide on whether you want to start paddle boarding or kayaking, then this blog post will help you make that decision.

In this post I will provide the arguments for and against paddle boards and kayaks so you can make your own decision about which one you would like to pursue as your new hobby. (Who knows, maybe you'll choose both!)

If you are unfamiliar of the differences between Kayaks and Paddle boards, don't worry, I've got you. I will run through the differences quickly now!

### So what are the key differences between Kayaks and Paddleboards?

The most obvious difference between the two vessels straight away is the hollow body of the kayak vs the more traditional hard body (or sometimes inflatable) of the paddle board.  This means that with a Kayak you have to sit within in it, but with a Paddleboard you can lie, sit stand or whatever you want to do on the board itself.

Another physical difference comes in the paddle.  With a Kayak you have a double ended dual blade paddle.  With a paddleboard it is a much simpler affair with one longer single blade paddle.

## Why do People like SUPs?

### Mobility and freedom to move around

Some people like a SUP for their the mobility.  For example if you can't sit for long periods of time then you may find a Kayak is not the right choice for you, in this way the Paddleboard wins every time, if you want to move about them.

## Why do people like Kayaks?

With a Kayak you do get a certain degree of storage space.

Most kayaks (but not all) provide considerably more storage than paddleboards.
