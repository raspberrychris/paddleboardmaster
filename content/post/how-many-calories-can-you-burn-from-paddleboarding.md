### Is Paddleboarding considered good exercise?

Is paddleboarding a good workout? Yes it is, SUP (Stand up paddleboarding) is a great strength workout. Not many activities provide both upper body training, leg work and core strength building at the same time.  So it is perfect for building up your strength.

**But how many calories can you burn from paddleboarding?** 

Calorie burn from SUP (Stand up Paddleboarding) can vary on a lot of factors.  For instance, what activity you are doing and what the water conditions are, are just some of the considerations that you need to take into account when working this out.

Luckily for you, we have done all the hard research into how many calories you can burn from paddleboarding and have discovered the following:

> **You can typically burn around 180-600 calories per hour depending on your weight from paddleboarding.**

This makes paddleboarding a great way to keep fit and also in a way that is low impact for your body.

On average it is a lighter intensity sport than surfing for most people, which would typically burn around 410 calories per hour.

The calories burnt from your workout depends on your activity whilst on the paddleboard, how vigorously you are paddling and also your weight.

We calculated the above calories burnt estimations using the data from [**Harvard Medical School**]()**.**

Ok so now we know the basics, let's jump into how many calories you can burn from specific activities whilst paddleboarding.

## How many calories can you burn from Yoga Paddleboarding?

We estimate that if you were doing Yoga on a paddleboard and know your downward-facing dog from your tree pose you are likely to burn at the higher end of the calorie scale, so around 500-600 calories per hour whilst doing Yoga on a paddleboard seems likely on average.

## How many calories can you burn from Paddleboard Surfing?

SUP surfing is a more active way to burn calories and is a fun at the same time.  Typically we would class SUP surfing as a more intense activity than SUP Yoga, meaning you would realistically be able to burn upwards of 500-700 calories per hour, dependent on the water condititions.

## How many calories can you burn from SUP Racing? 

If you are looking for the most intense paddleboard workout possible then you need to try paddleboard racing.  

With Paddleboard racing you can typically burn at the top end of the spectrum: Around 750-1000 calories an hour would be realistic for Paddleboard racing.

On average, stand up paddle board racing burns between 750-to-1,000 calories per hour. Of course, this depends on how much effort you’re putting into the sport. If you’re paddling with all your might, trying to cross the finish line first, then you’ll definitely burn more calories than if you were casually making your way through the water. SUP racing is great for those who are looking for a full-body workout that works on both strength and endurance. You’ll be burning calories while toning and strengthening muscles throughout your entire body.

If you are looking to burn even more calories by paddleboarding, you can use it as your main form of exercise and can extend the amount on time that you are paddleboarding.  Once you have mastered paddleboarding you can focus on stronger paddling and more higher intensity activities which will mean that you naturally burn more calories than you would do if you were a beginner learning how to paddleboard.
