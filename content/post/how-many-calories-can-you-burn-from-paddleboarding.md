Calorie burn from SUP (Stand up Paddleboarding) can vary on a lot of factors.  What activity you are doing, what the water conditions are just some of the consideration that you need to take into account.

We have done all the hard research into how many calories you can burn from paddleboarding and have discovered the following:

You can typically burn around 180-600 calories per hour depending on your weight from paddleboarding.

This makes it a great way to keep fit and also in a way that is low impact for your body.

On average it is a lighter intensity sport than surfing for most people, which would typically burn around 410 calories per hour.

The calories burnt from your workout depends on your activity whilst on the paddleboard, how vigorously you are paddling and also your weight.

We calculated the above calories burnt estimations using the data from [**Harvard Medical School**]()**.**

Let's jump into how many calories you can burn from specific activities whilst paddleboarding.

## How many calories can you burn from Yoga Paddleboarding?

Yoga on a paddleboard is definitely not the easiest activity to do and the instability of the board can really help work your core muscles.  

We estimate that if you were doing Yoga on a paddleboard and know your downward-facing dog from your tree pose you are likely to burn at the higher end of the calorie scale, so around 500-600 calories per hour whilst doing Yoga on a paddleboard.
