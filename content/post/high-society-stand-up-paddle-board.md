In this blog we will be taking a look at the [**High Society Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board**](#)  We will take you through the pros and cons of this paddleboard and will give my honest opinion on how it performs against the competition.

## High Society Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

The High Society paddle board is perfect for beginners or experienced riders who want a board for all conditions. It comes packed in an easy to carry backpack and inflates to 10‚Äô6‚Äù x 32‚Äù x 6‚Äù - which is more than enough room to sit comfortably for yoga, bring your dog, and even pack a cooler for drinks!

### Seven Layers of Materials

With the High Society SUP they make a special point of detailing all the different layers of the board.  Although a lot of SUPs talk about ‚Äòmilitary grade‚Äô materials, I think this is one of the most detailed examples of high quality design I have seen.

* 1. Outer Layer Protective PVC
* 2. Deck Pad
* 3. Mid Layer PVC
* 4. PVC Mesh
* 5. Inner PVC Sub Layer
* 6. Drop Stitch Core Base Cloth
* 7. Drop Stitch Core
