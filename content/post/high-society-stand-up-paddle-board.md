**Right, let‚Äôs get into it! Let‚Äôs go!**

## High Society Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

If you are looking for something that is a bit special, that has a more unique design then you may be interested in the [**High Society**](/categories/high-society/) stand up paddleboard.

> This SUP‚Äôs great design is actually designed by local artists, which makes these boards pretty special in my opinion.

This SUP‚Äôs look was designed by artist [**Robert Maestas**](https://www.robertmaestas.com/) for example.

It comes packed in an easy to carry backpack and inflates to 10‚Äô6‚Äù x 32‚Äù x 6‚Äù - which is more than enough room to sit comfortably for yoga, bring your dog, and even pack a cooler for drinks!

## 5/5

## Pros

* High quality materials
* A paddleboard from a brand with a fantastic reputation
* Look is designed by local artists

This paddleboard from High Society really is an exceptional paddleboard for the money.  In terms of its performance, look and design it scores top marks from me.

If you are looking for a SUP that looks as good as it performs and is from a good company with an excellent track record of looking after its customers then this may be the paddleboard for you.

> One of the strengths of this board in our opinion is the fairly rare 3 year warranty.

As you have seen other manufacturers are prepared to back their paddleboard with a 1 year warranty generally, but to get a 3 year warranty really is going over and above what we have seen here on [**paddleboardmaster.com**](/)**.**

Ultimately it seems that [**High Society**](/categories/high-society/) as a brand are a very customer focused company and they are willing to do everything they can to create the perfect paddleboard, and I think they have created something really special here with this particular SUP!

As mentioned above, you get a ton of accessories with this paddleboard, so you really have everything you need to get started in paddleboarding.  This is a paddleboard that anyone could get started with, although as it is less affordable than some of the other paddleboards we have reviewed it may mean that this is your second paddleboard or a more portable version of your existing hard top paddleboard.
