In this post I will be taking a look at the [**Dwzdd Inflatable Paddle Board **](#)and giving my honest review of how I think it performs in terms of its features and against other paddleboards.

**By the way…** [**Dwzdd**](#) is not a typo, I haven’t just mashed the keyboard by mistake, this is the actual brand name.

[**Dwzdd**](#) are a relatively new brand to the paddleboard scene, which is why you may not heard of them yet, but their boards are quickly gaining traction and have a number of positive reviews from customers who have bought their paddleboards.

At a first look their SUPs offer great value, high quality materials and are suitable for a wide range of people and activities.

The brand in general has got a lot of positive feedback so far.  They have two product lines at the time of writing, Gymastic tumbling mats and this line of inflatable paddleboard boards, this means they are very much focused on this type of market.

It goes without saying that a Gymnastic tumble mat is something that you would demand a high level of durability from, so it is interesting to see whether this follows through into their inflatable SUPs.

Join me while a take an indepth look at the Dwzdd inflatable paddleboard as I take it through its paces.

## Dwzdd Inflatable Paddleboard - Who is it for?

If you are looking for a first SUP and you don’t want to break the bank then this would be a good option in my opinion.

As I have mentioned Dwzdd is a fairly new brand on the market, but the paddleboard is high quality and comes with all the essential accessories you will need and also a double action pump that you can inflate and deflate your SUP with.  (It took around 10 minutes for me to inflate the board for reference).

> The Dwzdd inflatable paddleboard also has a anti slip EVA surface which is perfect for those who need a bit more traction on the board for their activities, for example if you want to use your paddleboard for Yoga.

In terms of the design of this board it is not overly flashy, it has a simple elegance to the design.  The logo is fairly large on the board which may detract for some, but I  like the bold styling here from Dwzdd.

## Features

## Verdict

### 4/5

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Pros

* Affordable paddleboard with great features and accessories
* Simple, sleek design
* Nice overall package
* Great Customer Service

## Cons

* Design may not be to everyone’s taste
* No Electric Pump

In terms of value for money you are getting a really good overall deal for this paddleboard from Dwzdd.

This would make a really good beginners SUP or someone who was just looking to enjoy SUPing on the weekends.

The paddleboard comes with all the essentials and the double action pump can deflate as well as inflate the board so you can be assured that you won’t be wasting any time.  It took 10 minutes for me to inflatate the board which is impressive at this price point!

Only cons that we could find is that the design may not be to everyone’s taste.  Obviously style is a personal choice, but with a wealth of designs and brands available, we though the design was more on the functional side than the style side.  Although saying that, there is an elegance to the simplicity of the design that I like.
