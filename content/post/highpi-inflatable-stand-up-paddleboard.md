In this post I will take a look at the [**Highpi stand up Paddleboard**](#) and give my honest opinion on how it performs on the water and provide an overall rating for this paddleboard.

If you are looking to get into a water sport activity then you can’t go far wrong with paddleboarding. One of the awesome things about it is that people buy paddleboards for different activities.  Some people are looking to burn a few calories, others want to practice Yoga or go fishing and some people just want to explore.  

When choosing the perfect paddleboard for you it is always worth taking these things into consideration.

Lets jump into what I think about the Highpi stand up paddleboard and how it compares to other paddleboards on the market.

## Who is the Highpi Stand Up Paddleboard for?

One of the standout features of this paddleboard is definitely the look.  The wood grain look is not something that you see that often on the designs of inflatable paddleboards, so if you are a fan of the natural wood grain look, then you will love this paddleboard.  

Customers who have bought this paddleboard focus on the fact that it is lightweight, easy to inflate, comes with a repair kit, its well made and overall it is easy to set up.  The product is highly recommended by most customers and is extremely popular choice as a good “All rounder” paddleboard.

Also customers have commented that it is a dog friendly board and that they have rode with their dogs on the board.  The surface of the Highpi is thick enough to stop dogs puncturing the board.
