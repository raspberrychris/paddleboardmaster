It is a paddleboard that can be used by beginners right up to the more advanced.  It is a wide, stable board that can be used by anyone of any age.

As it is inflatable it is a great SUP that you can pack away and throw in the car after you have finished paddleboarding.

In terms of set up is is also very simple and you don’t need any special experience to set up the board, everything is very self explanatory.

**This SUP has two thoughtful features which I really love.**

> Firstly, it has an action camera or GoPro holder.  This makes it easy to secure your camera to the board, so you can record your adventures without having to be concerned about losing your camera.

Secondly, this SUP also comes with a water proof cellphone holder which is included in the accessories.

All the usual safety features are included and you also get a repair kit included, which is useful if you were to damage the board.

### What is the quality of the materials like?

The board itself has drop stitch reinforced PVC.  Making it water proof and resistant to corrosion.  Like some of the other SUPs I have reviewed the quality level is described as “Military grade”.  The paddleboard also has a UV resistant coating.  It also features double layer fabric and space yarn.

This is a well thought out paddleboard from SereneLife and interestingly is described as being suitable for all ages, which I haven’t seen before.

The bottom line with this board is if you are looking for a good value high quality board, then this is going to interest you.

I think this board would be best suited towards someone who wants to adventure outdoors and record their adventures on their SUP.  The included GoPro holder makes it a breeze to ensure you get the best footage you can from and SUP, without being worried that you are going to lose your camera.

Another more obvious selling point of this board is the design.  It is eye catching graffiti inspired that carries all the way through to the accessories as well.

I really love it when the bag and the paddleboard feature the same design aesthetic, it just makes it feel like you are buying the complete package.

There aren’t too many negatives about this board to mention.  The price may be a limiting factor for some, and the design may not be for everyone.  The SUP doesn’t include an electric pump, but again, for me this wasn’t particularly a deal breaker.

Overall this is a great SUP from [**SereneLife**](/categories/serenelife/) and the aesthetic of the full package is actually amazing,  This is a SUP that you will be proud of any will keep for the long term.

Ultimately if you are looking to invest in a quality board and you love the design then this is a board that you will love from a brand that you can trust.
