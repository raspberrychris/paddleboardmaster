## Roc Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

So who is this paddleboard for?  We would say that this paddle board is best suited to those who are interested in getting started in paddle boarding.  The fact that it is inflatable means that you can store it away when it is not in use, but also makes it really convenient when you want to get away and explore the big outdoors!

In terms of the design, the black and white minimalist design is completly on point in our opinion.

We really love it!

So what do you get with this paddle board in terms of accessories?  The accessories that come with it (and there are a few!) also have the Roc branding on it, which makes this a stunning overall package to look at.  This is definitely a paddle board to be seen with, and it is nice to see a brand put so much effort into the accessories to accompany the paddle board.  

Perfect for trips to the beach on the weekends!

## Verdict

### 4/5

This is a fantastic beginners paddleboard and we really recommend it.  What we really love about it is the fact that it is easy to use, easy to set up and basically a whole lot of fun to use!

The water proof bag is an absolute bonus and means that you can pack it away really easy without worrying about it and store it easily away when not in use.

In terms of performance we would say that this board matches some of the best mid range solid boards out there.

The paddle floats if you drop it and also is extendable to a decent length, perfect if you are taller.  If you are a beginner looking to get into paddle boarding then this will be a very good choice for you to get started on.
