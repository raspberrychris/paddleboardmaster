The black and white minimalist design is completly on point.  

We really love it!

The accessories that come with it also have the Roc branding on it, which makes this a stunning overall package to look at.  This is definitely a paddle board to be seen with, and it is nice to see a brand put so much effort into the accessories to accompany the paddle board.  Perfect for trips to the beach on the weekends!
