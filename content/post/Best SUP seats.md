SUP ([Stand Up Paddleboarding](https://paddleboardmaster.com/post/how-to-stand-up-on-a-paddle-board/)) is most paddleboarder’s preferred way to enjoy the sport but standing for hours at a stretch can be tiring, particularly for those who are still wet behind the ears.

You’ll probably want to rest your back and legs at some point, and that’s when SUP seats come in handy.

Here are the best SUP seats to buy for your inflatable or solid paddleboard:

## 1. [SereneLife Universal paddleboard seat](https://www.amazon.com/SereneLife-SLSUPST15-Serene-Life-Paddle-Board/dp/B072JLYQ6H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8\&th=1)

![](/71yYjVG0mZL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Comfort and Support

This SUP seat is super comfortable for your back and butt. It has a high-back design which supports your upper and lower back excellently and a padded seat that protects your butt from soreness associated with long periods of sitting.

### Installation and compatibility

One of the best features of this seat is its versatility. It’s compatible with most paddleboards and kayaks. It comes with four straps for easy installation (two front and two rear straps). It’s also easy to remove just as it’s easy to install.

### Durability

This seat is made of a durable and thick foam (EVA foam) designed to withstand heavy use) with a durable, lightweight polyester exterior. Its hooks are sturdy and guaranteed to last long thanks to the premium quality copper used in manufacturing them.

Due to their constant exposure to water, hooks corrode easily, but the ones on this seat are highly resistant to corrosion, so you won’t have to worry about that.

### Other notable features

The SereneLife universal paddleboard seat isn’t called universal for nothing. It’s not only compatible with most paddleboards, but with all body sizes as well. Whether you have a small or large stature or you’re slim or chubby, this seat will accommodate you.

In addition to that, if you love fishing as much as you love paddleboarding, you’ll be glad to know that this SUP seat doubles as a fishing/rowboat seat.

### Upsides

* Easy to install and remove
* Provides good back and butt support
* Polyester exterior feels nice
* Versatile, multipurpose, and adjustable seat

### Downsides

* Butt padding could be thicker
* Scanty instructions might make installation a bit confusing

## 2. [Thurso Surf universal paddleboard seat](https://www.amazon.com/THURSO-SURF-Paddle-Comfortable-Relaxing/dp/B072NH38H5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)

![](/71f7zb2DeGS._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Comfort and support

Thurso Surf’s universal paddleboard seat is contoured to offer more comfort and support during long paddling sessions. It has a thick seat cushion for butt support and a high backrest for upper back and shoulder support.

Maintaining a good posture is crucial while sitting, and this seat’s backrest is tailored to keep you in a good posture which helps to prevent back pain and ease existing pain.

Paddling intensely might cause you to move around in your seat. This seat has an anti-slip bottom that prevents that from happening.

### Installation and compatibility

Just like a lot of other SUP seats, you’ll find four straps on this one for attaching it to your paddleboard (two on each side of the seat) plus clips that attach securely to D-rings.

This seat is easy to install, and after installation, you can adjust the straps until you find a fitting position for you. Since this is a universal seat, it can be used on pretty much any type of paddleboard.

### Durability

Thurso Surf’s seat has a unibody design and comprises long-lasting EVA foam, exterior PE material, and other materials that are made to last long and withstand prolonged use, harsh conditions, and resist corrosion.

Other notable features

A storage bag for storing personal items like keys, watches, and even drinks while paddling is included with this seat. The storage bag is also detachable, so if you have no need for it, you can take just the seat with you.

The adjustable straps on this SUP seat aren’t only designed to help you find a comfortable position to sit in. They have wide adjustment ranges which allow installation on other types of water sports equipment like kayaks.

### Upsides

* Ergonomic, comfortable and adjustable
* Easy and fast installation
* Comes with a detachable storage bag
* Anti-slip bottom
* Thick cushion

### Downsides

* Seat might feel too stiff to those who prefer soft seats

## 3. [BKC universal sit-on-top paddleboard seat](https://www.amazon.com/Brooklyn-Kayak-Company-Universal-Backrest/dp/B01MXW3FKG)

![](/71pfwilAv8L._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Comfort and support

The BKC (Brooklyn Kayak Company) seat has ample padding that provides you with all the comfort you’ll need and supports your lower back, legs, and torso as you explore the waters on your paddleboard.

It’s also adjustable, which enables you to position the seat perfectly for maximum comfort.

### Installation and compatibility

Installing this seat is a one-minute and three-step task. At the back of the seat, you’ll find two hooks to attach to the back rings. At the front, you’ll find another set of hooks to fasten to the front rings.

The last step is adjusting the seat to your liking by pulling the straps. That’s how easy it is to install and adjust.

Regarding compatibility, this is a universal seat that can be used with most paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, fishing boats, and more.

### Durability

Water sports equipment corrode easily due to the harsh conditions in which they are used. They are exposed to the scorching sun, heavy winds, and hard sea water all the time.

This seat has been manufactured with these considerations in mind. It’s made with woven nylon, a material that doesn’t fade easily even when constantly exposed to sunlight. It’s also resistant to water damage and doesn’t tear easily.

The hard parts of the seat are made of rust-proof, marine-grade brass material to enable you get as much use out of your seat as possible.

### Other notable features

BKC’s seat accommodates paddleboarders of all sizes and therefore can be shared with family and friends.

There’s a small water bottle pocket behind the backrest where you can keep your water bottle or any other personal belongings that can fit in.

### Upsides

* Comfy and stays in position after installation
* Easy to install, remove, and adjust
* Multipurpose seat for all kinds of watercraft
* Sturdy backrest
* Has a water bottle pocket

### Downsides

* Seat would be more comfortable with some extra cushion
* Slippery nylon material makes the seat slide at the bottom
* Water bottle pocket is a tad difficult to reach

## 4. [Nixy premium SUP seat](https://nixysports.com/products/premium-adjustable-kayak-seat)

![](/premium-kayak-seat-1_1800x1800.webp)

### Comfort and support

When the waters get rough, Nixy premium SUP seat provides you with a nice place to relax in as you brave the waters.

The seat and backrest both contain thick EVA cushions that make them super comfortable to sit and rest on. The seat is also flexible, so if you dislike rigid or stiff seats, you’ll like this one.

The backrest is semi-rigid, and it had to be made this way because this is the part that supports your back, hence it needs to be rigid enough to provide optimum support for your back.

The straps are wide and adjustable, allowing you to adjust the seat for optimal comfort regardless of your size and height.

Installation and compatibility

The installation process is simple. You just need to locate the tie-down points on your paddleboard and use the snap hooks to attach it to the board.

Nixy’s product is also compatible with a wide range of paddleboards. Unlike some of the other seats that come with four hooks, this one only has two. Given that some boards only have two anchor points, this seat is compatible with more paddleboards than those with four hooks.

### Durability

This seat is built to last. It contains thick EVA foam which won’t sag for a long time to come. The foam sits within the confines of a water-resistant neoprene fabric covering that decreases the likelihood of the seat getting wet.

The entire seat also has in-built channels for water drainage which speed up the drying process after exposure to water.

### Other notable features

Having this seat installed on your paddleboard elevates your entire experience to a whole new level. When you lean back, it inclines slightly, and it feels more relaxing as a result.

There's a handy, sizable pouch at the back of the seat for storing small items too.

### Upsides

* Easy to attach and detach
* Bonus storage behind the backrest
* Water resistant covering on the outside
* Thick cushion
* Sturdy and well-made

### Downsides

* A little bit pricey, relatively
* Needs the weight of your back to stay upright

## 5. [PaddleSit SUP seat](https://paddlesit.com/product/paddlesit/)

![](/617LzGIRRLL._AC_SL1136_.jpg)

### Comfort and support

Paddling is done in either a kneeling, standing, or sitting position, but PaddleSit’s SUP seat allows you to kneel and sit at the same time. This innovative product aligns your legs for maximum comfort and supports your butt with its ample padding.

One of the highlights of this seat is that it doubles as a conventional paddleboard seat if you prefer to use it that way. You’ll most likely use it both ways because staying in one position for too long taxes the muscles and joints involved.

Starting in a kneeling position (which this seat makes super comfortable compared to just kneeling) would be my preferred way to begin. When you get tired, you can use the top seat as a backrest while your butt rests on the lower seat.

You can also move the seat forward if you wish to switch to a standing position. You could keep switching from standing to kneeling to sitting positions and go on paddling for hours without getting exhausted. Other seats don’t offer you this flexibility.

### Installation and compatibility

PaddleSit has made it so easy to start paddling in full gear by making the easiest-to-install seat on the market.

You don’t need any tools, straps, or D-rings to install this product. You just need to place it in the center of your paddleboard and you’re good to go. This means it’s compatible with all types and makes of paddleboards.

However, if you want it to stay put, you can use the holes on the sides to attach it to your board with straps. This is totally optional.

### Durability

A simple glance at this seat tells you all you need to know about its durability. It’s not your typical seat and it’s far more expensive than regular seats.

It features an aluminum frame, and its water-resistant cushions are made of closed cell foam and cork enclosed in a washable nautical material.

The longevity of this seat is not in question; it’s designed to last long. And if any part of it gets damaged, you can purchase a replacement part as all of its parts are sold separately.

### Other notable features

Since this seat simply sits on your board, you might be wondering what would happen if it fell into the water.  That’s unlikely, but if it ever happens, you’ll just need to pick it off the water and place it back on your board. Yes, it floats on water!

This product is also useful for other purposes aside from paddleboarding. It can serve as a yoga and meditation seat, or a seat for small tables.

### Upsides

* Easiest installation process compared to other products
* Allows you to switch to three different positions (kneeling/standing/sitting)
* Offers exceptional comfort
* Ideal for long hours of paddling
* Durable and safe
* Compatible with all paddleboards
* Spare parts are available

### Downsides

* Low backrest only supports lower and middle back
* Not recommended for choppy or turbulent waters
* Expensive

## 6. [Pelican Boats SUP seat](https://www.amazon.com/Pelican-Boats-Sit-top-Universal/dp/B07FLBPFWW)

![](/81kANVZiFfL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Comfort and support

Pelican Boat’s SUP seat is a low-back seat, so it won’t support your upper back and shoulders, but it offers enough support to stay comfortable during short or moderately long trips on water.

This seat has a low amount of padding so it’s not very comfortable to sit and rest your back on. It’s more suitable for kids or smaller adults. Big or heavy adults probably won’t find this comfortable enough to sit in for extended periods of time.

### Installation and compatibility

If you have a paddleboard with D-rings, then you can install this seat on it. If yours doesn’t have them, you may need to purchase the mounting kit that is sold separately.

To attach this seat to your paddleboard, you simply need to connect the four straps to the D-rings and adjust as needed.

### Durability

This seat is just like any regular SUP seat and therefore should last a good while if it’s used by a kid or small adult.

Its outer covering is a water-resistant nylon material which keeps the seat from getting wet and consequently extends its life.

### Other notable features

As a kid seat, this product is perfect because it’s lightweight and offers enough support for a kid or small adult. Aside from that, there isn’t anything else worth mentioning that hasn’t already been mentioned.

### Upsides

* Good enough for kids and small adults
* Can be installed on any paddleboard with the mounting kit
* Lightweight seat

### Downsides

* Thin cushion makes it uncomfortable for large adults
* Backrest is too low
* Backrest zipper comes loose during use, making it unstable

## 7. [Woowave SUP seat](https://www.amazon.com/WOOWAVE-Adjustable-Cushioned-Comfortable-Detachable/dp/B07VDBZXH5)

![](/71DgV5qAkRL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Comfort and support

Thick cushions offer more comfort, and Woowave’s seat has a lot of it. It’s filled with enough padding to keep you comfortable for hours so you can focus on enjoying the experience instead of worrying about dead butt syndrome.

The straps are adjustable and the seat doesn’t move around while paddling. It stays in place thanks to its anti-skid material, allowing you to enjoy the ride to the maximum.

The backrest has ample padding just like the seat, and it’s a high backrest, which means your back will be fully supported during your water trips.

### Installation and compatibility

Connecting this seat to your paddleboard is easy as pie. It just needs to be hooked up to the anchor points on your paddleboard and adjusted according to your needs using the straps.

This seat can also be installed on most paddleboards. If yours isn’t compatible with it, you can make minor modifications to make it compatible, like adding extra D-rings to your paddleboard.

### Durability

The straps on this seat are reinforced straps. They’re strong enough to secure the seat to your paddleboard for years at a stretch.

The backrest and seat are padded with durable EVA foam, and the entire seat is covered with high-quality polyester material that can hold out against constant pressure and stretching.

### Other notable features

A waterproof, removable storage bag that attaches to the back of the backrest is included with this seat. Woowave also offers a 12-month money-back and replacement guarantee to all buyers.

Finally, if you own a rowboat, fishing boat, kayak, or canoe, you won’t need two seats because you can attach this seat to these watercrafts as well.

### Upsides

* High backrest supports entire back
* Thick cushion provides adequate support
* Anti-skid material keeps seat firmly in place
* Tough polyester exterior holds out against pressure
* Money-back and replacement guarantee

### Downsides

* Removable storage bag isn’t fully waterproof
* A few design flaws make installation difficult on some paddleboards
* Hooks need oiling to prevent corrosion

## 8. [Leader Accessories SUP seat](https://www.amazon.com/Leader-Accessories-Black-Deluxe-Kayak/dp/B01GFSNQBK)

![](/61wrjdRrL9S._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Comfort and support

EVA foam seems to be the standard in SUP seat cushions and that’s the type of foam this seat’s padding is made of. It’s comfortable to sit on, and it allows you to sit through long hours of paddling by virtue of the thickness of the foam.

Just like its counterparts, it comes with adjustable straps that allow you to put the seat in the perfect position to deliver the utmost comfort and support to your back and butt.

Leader Accessories’ ergonomic seat also has a high backrest for upper and lower back support.

### Installation and compatibility

The two rear and two front hooks are designed to connect this seat to any paddleboard with D-rings. The adjustable straps also enable you to adapt this seat to any paddleboard.

### Durability

The hooks on paddleboard seats can corrode with constant exposure to sea water. Leader Accessories combats this with their reinforced brass, corrosion-resistant hooks.

The exterior polyester material this seat is wrapped in is a high-quality one, so you can safely expect it to last long if you end up buying this product.

### Other notable features

Like some of the other products in this guide, this one is also packaged with a waterproof, removable storage bag secured behind the backrest. One other feature worth mentioning is the size of the seat. It’s large enough for kids and adults of all sizes.

### Upsides

* Thickly padded seat provides excellent comfort
* Compatible with pretty much all paddleboards
* Adjustable straps
* Durable corrosion-resistant hooks
* High backrest for full back support
* Easy and fast installation
* Large-sized seat accommodates paddleboarders of all sizes

### Downsides

* It’d be even more comfortable if they added a bit more padding to the seat area
* Due to the flexibility of the backrest, it doesn’t offer as much lower back support as it does upper back support

## 9. [Aero SUP inflatable seat](https://www.boteboard.com/products/aero-sup-paddle-seat)

![](/BASPS21SF-06-min.webp)

### Comfort and support

The Aero inflatable SUP seat is an incredibly comfortable seat that is large enough to accommodate paddleboarders of all sizes (up to 300 lbs).

Since it’s inflatable, you won’t have the worries that other seats bring about, like worrying about whether it’s soft enough for you or whether its padding is thick enough to support your body.

The seat comes with a backrest that lets you rest your back in a comfortable reclining position. The backrest doesn’t fall forward like in some other seats; it stays upright even when you stand up.

### Installation and compatibility

To attach this seat to your paddleboard, you just need to connect its tie-down straps to their corresponding attachment points.

This product is intended for BOTE paddleboards and therefore isn’t compatible with other boards.

If you don’t have an Aero BOTE paddleboard and you really want to use this seat, then you’ll probably need to make some modifications to your board to install it successfully.

### Durability

Seeing as this is an inflatable seat, it’s likely to last longer than the cheap non-inflatable seats on the market if you take good care of it.

The inflatable material is made of tough PVC and composite drop stitch fibers. In layman’s terms, it doesn’t get damaged easily.

Other notable features

There is a pouch behind the seat for storing phones, wallets, and other personal items. Aero also offers a 2-year warranty with every purchase.

### Upsides

* Easy to carry around. Simply deflate and inflate.
* Easy to install
* Constructed with durable materials
* Highly comfortable
* Large enough for people of all sizes

### Downsides

* Pricey
* Designed for Aero paddleboards only

## 10. [Harmony Gear SUP seat](https://www.amazon.com/Harmony-Gear-Standard-Sit-Black/dp/B00HA94EPQ)

### Comfort and support

Although this seat has thin padding, it’s soft and comfortable enough for short water trips. In addition to that, it offers good back support and can be adjusted to suit your requirements.

Its anti-skid bottom prevents the seat from sliding while paddling. This is a necessity since sliding can be quite irritating when all you want to do is sit comfortably and enjoy the ride.

### Installation and compatibility

So long as your paddleboard has the requisite D-rings for installation or you’re willing to install the D-rings, you can use this seat with any paddleboard. The front and rear straps hook up to the D-rings to secure the seat in an upright position.

### Durability

This is a lightweight and inexpensive seat, but it’s durable enough to be worth the money. It also features corrosion-resistant hardware.

Other notable features

The backrest is designed to conform to the shape of the human body, and for this reason, its back support is a bit better compared to seats with flat backrests. It’s also compatible with kayaks.

### Upsides

* Lightweight and easy to carry around
* Curved backrest offers extra back support
* Easy to install

### Downsides

* Thin padding
* Only good for short trips
* Anti-skid material doesn’t do its job properly

## What to look for in a SUP seat

1. Water-resistant material: SUP seat materials should be waterproof or water-resistant to prevent them from soaking up water. Wet seats won’t be as comfortable to sit in as dry ones, so to ensure maximum comfort, you need a seat that doesn’t get wet easily.
2. Durable materials: Make sure the seat you’re considering buying is made of materials that can withstand the harsh conditions it will most likely be exposed to, like the hard sea water, sunlight, and pressure from sitting on it for hours.
3. Compatibility: Before you buy a SUP seat, check your paddleboard to see if it's compatible. Some paddleboards have D-rings for seat installation, while others don’t. If yours doesn’t come with D-rings, you can purchase them separately and attach them to your board.
4. Ease of installation: Most SUP seats are very easy to install, so this isn’t an important consideration, but I still recommend you find out how it’s installed just to be sure you won’t have any trouble installing it.
5. Padding: The amount of cushion in a SUP seat determines how comfortable it will be to a large extent. Check the thickness of the padding and decide if it’s thick enough for you or not. The heavier you are, the more thickness you’ll need to feel comfortable.
6. Height of backrest: If you need support for your lower and upper back, go for a seat that has a high backrest. If you just need low/mid back support, pick one with a low backrest.
7. Price: Generally, the higher the quality of a seat, the higher its price. Pick a seat that strikes a balance between the quality it offers and the price you’re willing to pay for it.

## Benefits of SUP seats: why you need one

1. You can take your kid or pet along and give them the same awesome experience you enjoy every time you hop on your board. It’s hard to do this with you and your kid/pet standing, but much easier when they have a seat to relax in.
2. SUP seats transform your paddleboard into a kayak or boat. Riding on your paddleboard feels like riding in a boat when you’re in a sitting position.
3. Seats allow you to switch positions and exercise different parts of your body. They also give you the option of resting your legs when you get tired of standing.
4. If you’re paddling in a scenic spot like those found in Lake Tahoe, you’ll want to take multiple pictures and selfies. It’s easier to take good photos while sitting since you’ll have more stability and balance.
5. SUP seats are perfect for beginners. The board stays in balance while sitting, which makes it possible for beginners to enjoy this amazing water sport as they learn how to SUP.

## Final thoughts

Personal preference and taste come into play when deciding on what the best SUP seat to buy for you or your kid is, so it pays to consider all the important factors such as thickness of padding, height of backrest, and price, along with other factors not related to preferences like durability before picking a seat.
