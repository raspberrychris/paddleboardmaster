If you are looking for a premium looking paddleboard (without the premium price tag!) then you may find the [**Luclear Inflatable Paddle Board**](#) a great choice, just like I do.  So what exactly do you get with this paddleboard?

The Luclear paddleboard is a wide board that has a non-slip SUP design.  It is suitable for a wide range of activities, which is what I love about it - it makes it really versatile and if you are not a regular user of your paddleboard then you can share it with friends or family and they can also get enjoyment from the paddleboard.

One of the key strengths of this paddleboard, apart from the fact that it is great for beginners is that it is a very steady board that can support up to 330lbs, which is around 1-2 people, or a single person and a pet.  (We don’t encourage people to take their pets on paddleboards, but we know that some people do like to do this with well trained animals).
