Stand up paddleboarding is a fun, affordable outdoor activity that requires little skill to begin, but not everyone wants to be a hardcore or professional paddleboarder participating in SUP racing competitions, riding huge waves, and braving stretches of white water with an expensive board.

If you’re the type of person that just wants to get a good workout in or relax and enjoy a pleasant trip on calm waters during summer weekends, what you need is a cheap inflatable stand up paddleboard.

Cheap doesn't equate to low-quality, even though there are low-quality boards out there. The best cheap Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboards (iSUPs) provide everything you’ll need for recreational SUPing without an over-the-top compromise on quality.

With that being said, these are the boards I recommend for budget-conscious paddleboarders:

### Design

The SereneLife inflatable paddleboard bundle includes a beautiful and durable paddleboard made of drop-stitch reinforced PVC material. This paddleboard has a number of features that aid comfort, weight distribution, and prevent accidents.

The wider a board is, the easier it is to balance yourself on it. The board in this iSUP bundle is 32 inches wide, which is more than enough to make balancing easier, even for beginners.

At ten feet six inches, It’s a medium length board and this is the ideal length for SUP yoga and leisurely paddling.

The deck pad is made of anti-slip material that keeps it non-slippery even when it’s wet. The top deck is also soft, so if you ever fall, you’ll be landing on a cushioned surface that ensures you don’t sustain any injuries.

### Performance & usage

To start using this board, you just need to inflate it using the pressure pump it comes with and attach the fins. Then slide the pieces of the paddle into place, adjust its height, and you’re ready to rock and roll.

You’ll find this board easy to steer and maneuver while out on the water thanks to its three bottom panel fins. Its paddle floats, so if it falls off the board, you can easily retrieve it.

This board is six inches thick with a weight limit of 300 pounds, so two people of average weights can use it at the same time. It also has bungee tie-downs and four D-rings to attach a SUP seat.

### Durability

The material this board is made of is suitable for paddling on fresh water and salt water. The outer part of the board is treated with a protective coating to prevent sun damage and corrosion. The paddle is made of aluminum and it’s durable as well.

![](/71hxe7FO4lS._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Design

When you simply want to cruise the waters or try different SUP yoga poses, this is the kind of paddleboard you want to take with you. It’s wide enough (33 inches) for all types of yoga poses and wide enough to accommodate extra items like food and fishing gear, along with a kid or pet.

This board also has a respectable length of 11 feet that helps a lot with stability. It’s made of a lightweight PVC material that is reinforced to prevent damage with an anti-slip deck pad to keep you from slipping and falling.

### Performance & usage

This paddleboard inflates fast. Using the packaged manual pump, you’ll have a fully inflated board in less than ten minutes. An automatic pump will speed up inflation significantly, so consider getting one to make your life easier.

The paddle comes in three pieces which you need to put together. It also has a lock that allows you to adjust its height when opened.

Three fins under the six-inches-thick paddleboard serve to improve its stability and maneuverability and all three fins are detachable.

With a weight limit of 330 pounds, you can SUP with your pet or kid and bring all the extra items you need without going beyond the weight limit.

## [Akaso Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard](https://www.amazon.com/AKASO-Inflatable-Paddle-10x30x6-Paddleboard/dp/B0B76MW64J/ref=zg_bs_5522381011_sccl_6/137-3847782-7222815?th=1)

![](/71l7nLl57BL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Design

The Akaso iSUP bundle is excellent for short and long recreational SUPing. Its ten-feet-long board is tailored to help you cover more distance on the water with less strokes. It also offers you 30 inches of width to fit all the items you’ll need on your trips.

The board consists of a drop-stitch fiber core that supports it against your weight. Its exterior inflatable material is made of high-quality military-grade PVC with a non-slip deck pad on the top for smoother trips.

### Performance & usage

While out on the water, the three fins under the board work to make maneuvering the board easy. You’ll need to attach the removable fin after inflating the board before you can use it.

The double-action manual pump can inflate the board within minutes, and it has a gauge to help you stay within the recommended pressure limits like most of the other paddleboards at similar price points to this one.

When you’re done SUPing, it takes only minutes to deflate and store the board. The board is six inches thick and has a weight limit of 300 pounds. That’s a lot of volume for a paddleboard that won’t set you back up to $200.

The paddle is adjustable and consists of three pieces that need to be joined to form a paddle with a maximum height of 81 inches. Tie-downs at the nose of the board hold your items securely to keep them from falling off.

### Durability

Two layers of PVC protect the board from scrapes, punctures, and leaks, while the double sidewall improves stability and offers protection as well. The included repair kit enables you to fix small holes and leaks, obviating the need to shell out money for a new board.

### Accessories

This iSUP bundle gives you access to a waterproof bag to store your phone and other belongings. You also get a fast hand pump, one center fin to attach to the board, an ankle leash, and a repair kit.

A large backpack houses the board and its accessories and lightens your burden when moving to your paddleboarding spot.

## [Funwater Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard](https://www.amazon.com/FunWater-Inflatable-Ultra-Light-Everything-Waterproof/dp/B07MC3TNMM/ref=zg_bs_5522381011_sccl_7/133-3160810-2048665?psc=1)

![](/71IW-rfFiBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Design

SUPing with lightweight paddleboards is the in thing these days. Some of the newer paddleboards on the market are manufactured with light PVC material, and so is this Funwater paddleboard.

This medium-length board (ten feet six inches long) is perfect for beginners and seasoned paddleboarders alike going on a relaxing water trip. It’s 33 inches wide too, enough width to offer optimal stability and balance for recreational SUPing, fishing, and yoga.

Like most of the cheaper boards on the market, this board is easy to use. Beginners will quickly get accustomed to it even if it’s their first time using a paddleboard.

### Performance & usage

This board is very stable on water even with a pet on board wiggling about. With six inches of board thickness, it can easily support you and an extra person or pet as its weight limit of 330 pounds is difficult to exceed for the average paddleboarder.

This iSUP bundle includes a manual pump that is comfortable to use, although you’ll need to expend a decent amount of energy to inflate the board. There are three fins under the board, one of which is removable.

A height-adjustalble three-piece paddle is included in the bundle. Assembling the pieces is a piece of cake and takes just a few minutes.

Once you’re ready to set out for your leisurely cruise, you can strap your belongings to the board using the tie-downs to ensure you don’t lose them.

### Durability

Most people prefer floating paddles because they can save you the expense of buying a new paddle if it falls off. This Funwater iSUP bundle includes a floating aluminum paddle.

The board is highly durable thanks to its double-walled construction. It even holds its own against fairly sharp rocks.

### Accessories

You need several basic accessories for paddleboarding and this iSUP bundle has it all, aside from a PFD and whistle. It includes a board, a coil safety leash, paddle, small waterproof bag for personal belongings, and a backpack to hold everything during trips.

## [Aqua Plus Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard](https://www.amazon.com/Aqua-Plus-11ftx33inx6in-Inflatable-Adjustable/dp/B08ZK83N16/ref=zg_bs_5522381011_sccl_8/133-3160810-2048665?psc=1)

![](/91134BHNjTL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Design

If you want a well-made inflatable board that feels like a solid board during use, the Aqua Plus iSUP bundle offers you that and more.

The board in this bundle is made of high-quality, lightweight PVC that minimizes board weight without compromising on quality. It also contains a layer of PVC board rails that firm up the board and make it feel like a hard one.

The length of the board is 11 feet, and it’s within the length range you should be looking at for recreational SUPing. There’s a non-slip deck pad at the center of the top deck to keep you stable on choppy waters.

At 33 inches, its width is sufficient for any recreational paddleboarder. It’s wide enough to accommodate everything you’re likely to bring on board.

### Performance & usage

The hand pump in this iSUP bundle is one to love. It allows you to switch between double action and single action pumps.

When you want to inflate the board, you start with double action pumps to get to a high pressure reading faster, then switch to single action pumps for precision so you can stay within the recommended pressure range.

The board can hold a maximum weight of 350 pounds, and that’s a limit no one is going to complain about. It's six inches thick too.

After inflating the board, you just need to slide the fin in to get it ready for use. This is a single-fin board, so it performs better on flat water compared to three-fin boards.

You can take advantage of the tie-downs to secure your belongings and accessories and use the D-rings on the deck pad to attach a SUP seat if you have one.

### Durability

Aqua Plus’ iSUP bundle includes a floatable and adjustable aluminum paddle, but it only floats for a while and needs to be retrieved as soon as possible if it falls into the water. Nevertheless, its floatability helps you retain it for as long as you want if you’re careful.

The board is sturdy and made of durable, quality PVC. It won’t leak easily, and it won’t fade easily either even with constant use.

### Accessories

Purchasing this bundle entitles you to the following items: a board, double-action manual pump, coiled leash, shoulder strap, waterproof bag, repair kit, and backpack.

## [JC Athletics Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard](https://www.amazon.com/JC-ATHLETICS-Inflatable-Accessories-Adjustable-10-5X32X6/dp/B09Q111V5B/ref=zg_bs_5522381011_sccl_11/133-3160810-2048665?psc=1)

![](/71iPH-gleVL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Design

This paddleboard is built with a thick layer of PVC and drop stitch fibers for easier and lasting inflation.

It also has the right dimensions for leisurely SUPing, sacrificing some speed for extra storage space and easier balancing.

Longer and narrower boards are faster, but if you need a cheap inflatable board you probably don’t need the extra speed. You likely just need a moderately fast paddleboard with enough space to carry food, fishing gear, and a pet.

This ten feet six inches long and 32 inches wide board suits your needs perfectly if that’s the kind of board you need.

### Performance & usage

This six-inches-thick paddleboard handles well and allows a maximum weight of 320 pounds, which should be more than enough even for big individuals.

The non-slip deck pad on the top deck will keep you balanced during your trips as you explore the waters, and the fins will help with maneuvering while out on choppy or flat water.

One of the fins is removable and needs to be installed before using the board. At the nose of the board, you’ll find a storage area with tie-down straps for securing your stuff.

The pump in this bundle isn’t just an inflation pump. It deflates the board too when switched to the “IN” setting, while the “OUT” setting does the opposite. This bundle also provides you with an adapter for automatic pumps.

### Durability

The quality of the paddleboard in JC Athletics’ iSUP bundle is so good you could mistake it for a solid/hard board if you didn’t look carefully. Its PVC material is of military-grade quality and guaranteed to last long if you take good care of the board. The paddle floats too!

### Accessories

JC Athletics offers you an iSUP bundle that consists of a nice board, removable fin, floatable paddle, manual pump that inflates and deflates, leash, backpack, and an adapter for automatic pumps, all for less than $200.

## [Feath-R-Lite Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard](https://www.amazon.com/Feath-R-Lite-Inflatable-Ultra-Light-Paddleboard-Accessories/dp/B0BGXLR7L9/ref=zg_bs_5522381011_sccl_20/133-3160810-2048665?psc=1)

![](/71nw-H9MoiL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Design

The Feath-R-Lite iSUP bundle is the perfect iSUP bundle for beginners buying their first paddleboard.

The paddleboard in this bundle is made of a durable, military-grade PVC material that is resistant to wear and tear, making it a great practice board that you can use to make all your newbie mistakes before buying your dream board.

It’s ten feet long and 30 inches wide and smaller than most of the boards reviewed here, but it’s on par with the others despite its marginal size difference.

The board also has a plain design with a slip-resistant deck pad on top. A board with a plain design like this one will lend you prominence among all the brightly-colored and patterned boards out there.

### Performance & usage

The steps you need to ready this board for use are like the steps for other cheap boards. Inflate the board, slide the fin in, put your phone in the waterproof bag, strap it and other items you have on the tie-downs, assemble the paddle, and you’re ready to go on an exciting paddleboard trip.

Being a smaller board, this board has a relatively low weight limit. It’s six inches thick, and It can hold up to 280 pounds so feel free to bring a friend or pet along.

It’s easy to maintain stability on this board in sitting and standing positions, and thanks to its high-quality construction it offers firm rides across lakes, rivers, and reservoirs.

### Durability

This board is reinforced with another layer of military-grade PVC to protect it from damage. It should have a long service life if properly taken care of.

### Accessories

Feath-R-Lite's iSUP bundle includes a board, leash, pump, removable fin, adjustable three-piece paddle, waterproof phone bag, and a backpack.

## [iRocker Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard](https://www.amazon.com/iROCKER-Nautical-Inflatable-Paddle-Board/dp/B08MVC1V5B/ref=zg_bs_5522381011_sccl_26/133-3160810-2048665?th=1)

![](/81XV2YfevbL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Design

The iRocker iSUP bundle will cost you a bit more than all the other products in this list, but you get a better board and higher quality accessories in return.

The paddleboard is made of a dual layer of PVC and drop-stitch fibers and it’s ten feet six inches long. It has a width of 32 inches, which means you can SUP with an extra person or a pet. Its width serves to ease balancing too.

Unlike most cheap boards that come with just one carry handle at the center of the board, the iRocker iSUP has three carry handles, one at the nose and one at the tail in addition to the center handle.

There are four safety handles on the board as well, two at the front and two at the rear, plus a slip resistant deck pad on the top deck. You can purchase this paddleboard in blue, gray, and teal colors.

### Performance and usage

This paddleboard tracks well for a cheap board, and it offers a good amount of stability, maneuverability, and speed on water.

The weight limit of this board is a bit lower than most in its price range. It can support a maximum of 240 pounds but that should be enough for most casual paddleboarders.

The board is six inches thick and remains stable on water so long as you don’t exceed the maximum weight considerably.

This iSUP bundle includes a dual-action hand pump that speeds up the inflation process almost as fast as a manual pump can. If you want to inflate the board faster, your only other option is an automatic pump.

Three fins are included inside this bundle – two side fins and one main center fin – and all of them are detachable.

Most cheap boards offer you just one storage area with tie-downs for strapping down important items. This one offers you two tie-down areas, one at the front and one behind you. It also has D-rings for installing a SUP seat and a mount for installing a GoPro camera.

### Durability

It’s hard to imagine this paddleboard not having a long service life. Boards that aren’t as good as this one last long so this one certainly will with proper care.

Its three-piece, adjustable paddle is floatable to allow easy retrieval whenever it falls into the water. It’s also made of fiberglass, unlike most cheap iSUP bundles that give you aluminum paddles.

Fiberglass paddles are superior to aluminum ones. Fiberglass is stiffer than aluminum and therefore propels your board further than an aluminum paddle would with the same stroke and the same amount of power.

Fiberglass is also lighter, which means less exhaustion and muscle strain during and after a trip.

### Accessories

The iRocker Nautical iSUP bundle comprises a good quality board, 10-foot leash, three removable fins, dual-action hand pump, fiberglass paddle, and repair kit.

This bundle also includes a backpack that is better than what other bundles in this price range offer. It’s an above-average backpack and you can add a wheel to it to make it even easier to carry your board and accessories to your launch spot.

## How to pick the best cheap inflatable paddleboard

1. If you’re buying a paddleboard for an adult, it needs to be at least ten feet long, 30 inches wide, and six inches thick regardless of its price. These moderately-sized boards offer the right amount of speed and balance for beginners and for recreational SUPing.
2. If you intend to use your board mostly on flat water, pick a single-fin board or a three-fin board that allows you to detach all three fins because boards perform better on flat water with a single fin attached. If you want to use the board on choppy waters and in windy conditions, pick a board with three fins.
3. Your accessories are almost as important as the board itself. Buy an iSUP bundle that contains all the accessories you’ll need and make sure their quality is up to par relative to the quality of the board.

## How to extend the life of your paddleboard

Seeing as you’re buying a cheap paddleboard, it’s crucial to take good care of it so it lasts long because cheap boards can’t withstand poor use like the expensive ones. They’re made of lower quality materials, so they need extra care to last long.

Here’s how to extend the life of your board:

1. Store It inside its backpack and out of direct sunlight.
2. Keep it away from direct heat and sheltered from extreme cold.
3. Avoid dragging your board no matter how smooth the surface is. Carry it instead using its carry handle.
4. Clean your board and store it properly after each use.
5. Minimize white water paddling. This will eventually take its toll on your board if done often.
6. Dogs will damage your board faster than most things will. Limit how often you SUP with your dog.

Something else that reduces the life of your board is how often you go paddleboarding, and I wouldn’t advise you to do it less to make your board last longer. Instead, spend more money on a higher quality board if you SUP more than three times per week and care about durability.

## Wrapping it up

The ten iSUP bundles I recommend in this article offer you the best budget boards but they aren’t all equal. The iRocker iSUP bundle offers better value than the rest of the boards in this guide and is my number one pick.

In the end, picking a bundle comes down to budget, quality, and trivial preferences like color and design, but you should be able to find a good entry-level board among these ten products that has all the features you need for recreational SUPing.
