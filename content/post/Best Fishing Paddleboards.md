Fishing on a paddleboard is a thrilling experience and there are several ways to go about it.

Some anglers use the top-down casting technique, some use the drift fishing technique, while others use the sight fishing technique, but one thing that all serious SUP anglers have in common is a fishing paddleboard.

Picking a fishing paddleboard as opposed to a [regular paddleboard](https://paddleboardmaster.com/post/which-paddleboard-is-the-best-for-beginners/) gives you the flexibility and stability you need to fish efficiently.

These paddleboards come with extra features like longer widths and lengths, higher weight capacities to accommodate the extra gear, and deck mounts for fishing rod holders, cameras, and other accessories.

After reviewing a good number of boards, these are the ones I recommend if you’re looking for the best fishing paddleboards on the market today:

![Nixy Monterey G4 Expedition Paddleboard](/monterey-aqua-inflatable-paddle-board-bundle_1800x1800.jpg)

### Overview

If you think yourself to be a ball of fire, this iSUP will aid you in your water adventures no matter how far you plan to float.

This paddleboard is designed for the ardent angler that fishes on familiar and unexplored waters. Its double air chambers is just the ticket for fishing in unfamiliar waters because it provides extra security to you and rigidity to the board.

Nixy’s G4 board is only 32 inches wide but that is still plenty of width to accommodate you and allow enough room for your fishing gear, cameras, and catches.

The length of the board is 11 feet six inches. While this won’t give you blistering speeds, it’s fast enough to get you to your preferred fishing spots quickly and cover a lot of ground while cruising the waters.

You can have as much as 400 pounds of weight on this board and it will stay afloat, so bring all the fishing gear you’ll need and feel free to catch as much fish as you want in compliance with the limits at the lake or river you’re fishing at.

The Nixy G4’s paddle is made of carbon fiber -- the highest-quality paddle material. Carbon fiber paddles are stiffer and lighter than fiberglass, aluminum, and plastic paddles, and they convert your strokes into movement more efficiently than the other types of paddles.

With this board, you can use as many accessories as you want because it comes with ten action mounts. You can install a GoPro camera and capture all the exciting moments of your fishing expedition, a speaker to liven yourself up with some good music, and a fishing rod holder to conveniently store your fishing rod when it’s not in use.

Speaking of storage, Nixy’s G4 paddleboard has two removable bungee tie-downs attached to the front and rear of the board.

### Usability and durability

This fishing iSUP includes three removable fins – a center fin and two side fins. It also allows you to fish while sitting by giving you the option of adding a kayak seat to the board.

Its D-rings are compatible with Nixy’s kayak seat which you can purchase separately if you need it.

There’s a soft, non-slip deck pad on the top of the board that gives you all the traction you need to stay balanced and stable while reeling in your well-deserved catches.

Everything about this iSUP bundle screams quality, from its dual layer military-grade PVC construction to its triple action pump. This is a fishing iSUP that will last for years, no doubt.

### Accessories

Nixy provides you with all the basic accessories you’ll need to use this paddleboard. Its premium backpack has enough room for all included accessories, and it’s a wheeled backpack so you can simply wheel it to your fishing spot if the terrain allows.

The bundled accessories include a hybrid leash (coiled and straight cord leash), a three-piece carbon fiber paddle, a triple-action hand pump, and a repair kit (valve wrench plus PVC patches).

## [Sea Eagle FishSUP 126 Paddleboard](https://www.seaeagle.com/FishingSUPs/FS126)

![](/FS126K_ST.jpg)

### Overview

Sea Eagle’s range of fishing paddleboards are the ultimate paddleboards for all types of anglers. Whether you prefer to fish with a motorized board or paddle manually, with a seat or while standing, there’s an iSUP bundle for you.

Before I go over the bundles they offer, let me explain the features they all have in common.

Each bundle includes a fishing paddleboard that is 40 inches wide. This paddleboard can hold all of your gear and accessories and still have enough room for an extra person or a pet.

There’s no point providing 40 inches of width without having the weight capacity to hold everything it can accommodate, and that’s why Sea Eagle’s paddleboard is complemented by a humongous 500 pounds weight limit.

Sea Eagles’s fishing iSUP has a length of 12 feet six inches. Any board above 12 feet in length is considered a long board and offers better speeds and straight-line tracking than medium-length boards, like the Nixy G4.

There are two storage options on this board – tie-down straps at the nose of the board for securing shoes, dry bags, and extra clothing, and a paddle pocket to put away your paddle when you’re reeling in a fish or when the board is being propelled by a motor.

Instead of a regular tail, this board has a swallow tail which allows for the attachment of an electric motor, an optional add-on that comes with some of the bundles that Sea Eagle offers.

You won’t find mounts on this board aside from the electric motor mount, but you can store your fishing rod and other items in the multipurpose storage box included in the bundle.

### Usability and durability

Some of Sea Eagle’s bundles include a kayak seat, and there are 14 D-rings on the paddleboard for attaching your own SUP seat if your bundle doesn’t include one, a leash, and other accessories.

You already know how important fins are for maneuverability and stability. This iSUP comes with twin side fins and a center fin that you can easily attach and remove when necessary. Sea Eagle recommends you remove the center fin when using the motor.

With this bundle you don’t need to purchase a separate fish ruler to know how large your catch is. A 36-inch fish ruler is built into the board.

The comfortable foam deck pad keeps you from slipping and prevents punctures from fish with sharp spines. To enjoy the extra protection the deck pad offers, you’ll need to make sure you reel your catch onto the deck pad.

Sea Eagle’s iSUP is constructed with several layers of drop-stitch fabric and sheets that provide protection to the board and improve durability.

The paddle in the base bundle is formed from fiberglass material -- the next best material to make a paddle with. It’s stiff and light and it’s not going to break or tire you out quickly.

### Accessories

This is a complete iSUP bundle. The base package comprises a three-piece adjustable fiberglass paddle, a repair kit, a fast-inflating double-action hand pump, a multipurpose storage box, and a wheelless backpack.

Sea Eagle offers six iSUP bundles and each subsequent bundle comes with more expensive accessories:

* **Start Up package**: This is the base package and it includes everything mentioned above.
* **Deluxe package**: Everything in Start Up plus Kayak seat, extra aluminum paddle, and a valve adapter.
* **Swivel Seat Fishing Rig package**: Everything in Start Up plus a rotating swivel seat and extra aluminum paddle.
* **Pro Motor Fishing Rig package**: Everything in the Swivel package plus an electric motor and a power center (does not include batteries).
* **50w Solar Boat package**: Everything in the Pro Motor package plus a 50w solar panel.
* **Bixpy Motor package**: Everything in the Swivel package plus an electric motor kit that includes a lighter and quieter electric motor than the one found in the previous packages and batteries to power it.

## [Bote Rackham Aero Paddleboard](https://www.boteboard.com/collections/fishing-paddle-boards/products/rackham-aero-110-classic-cypress-inflatable-paddle-board)

![](/110iRK22FT-photo-02-min.webp)

### Overview

Bote is recognized as a premium paddleboard brand, and one of their premium products is the Rackham Aero fishing iSUP.

This 11-foot lightweight board is an angler’s dream board. It offers 36 inches of width and has a weight limit of 300 pounds.

This board is packed with tons of features and Bote sells a number of accessories to make your life easier all of which are compatible with this board.

While fishing, you might occasionally have the need to free your hands so you can reel in your catch. The paddle sheath at the nose of the board allows you to store the paddle in an upright position in order to free your hands for other activities.

Front and rear adjustable bungee straps are available on the board along with tie-down points for a cooler. You can also fix rod holders, cameras, and other accessories to it using the attached action mounts.

### Usability and durability

Two side fins and a removable center fin keep the board stable as you explore new fishing spots. The recessed non-slip deck reduces your center of gravity and that helps with stability too.

The Bote Rackham Aero has mounting points for all the extra gear and accessories that Bote offers.

There are anchor mounting points if you want to keep your board stationary while fishing, carry strap mounting points, a Magnepod (magnetic pod that is used to attach waterproof speakers, tumblers, and koozies to the board), Rac mounts (for attaching a variety of Bote accessories designed for pimping up your board), and attachment points for Bote’s SUP seat.

The Bote Rackham Aero is a two-chamber paddleboard that is rigid, lightweight, and has incredible build quality. It holds up well after years of use.

### Accessories

This iSUP bundle has a three-piece adjustable paddle, a hand pump, a repair kit, and a rolling travelling bag. It also includes Aero Rac receivers, a detachable paddle sheath, a detachable center fin, and a Sandspear sheath (for shallow water anchoring).

## [Glide 02 Angler Fishing Paddleboard](https://www.glidesup.com/products/02-angler)

![](/Untitleddesign_6_1200x.webp)

### Overview

Stability is one of the hallmarks of the Glide 02 Angler, a fishing paddleboard that boasts a massive 500-pound weight limit, 36 inches of board width, and 11 feet of board length, making it the perfect paddleboard for exploring new waterways and honing your fishing skills.

It has a woven drop-stitch core that gives the board a lightweight feel and provides optimum stability when casting, reeling, and landing.

It has ample storage too. You can strap all of your items and gear to the board using the tie-downs in front of you. If that’s not sufficient, there’s another set of tie-downs at the tail of the board too.

The Glide 02 paddleboard includes two front and two rear mounts. The front mounts are intended for attaching rod holders. The rear mounts on the other hand are Scotty mounts designed for attaching compatible accessories.

This bundle includes a three-piece adjustable paddle that is made of fiberglass to enable you cover more distance with less strokes and keep you SUPing for hours with less exhaustion.

### Usability and durability

The Glide 02 Angler has one removable fin and two fixed side fins for extra stability and easier turning, factors that are particularly important given the size of this paddleboard.

A deck pad on the top of the board provides great comfort and traction and helps you maintain your footing while fishing.

This board is compatible with most kayak or SUP seats on the market. It comes with four D-rings and a nylon loop on either side for anchoring.

As far as durability goes, this board is built to hold out against the harsh conditions fishing boards are exposed to. Its deck pad doesn’t fade but maintains its original colors unlike cheaper alternatives.

Additionally, it has a woven drop-stitch core and four layers of high-grade PVC with welded rails that provide the stiffness and sturdiness needed for maximum longevity.

### Accessories

The Glide 02 Angler fishing iSUP has a familiar collection of accessories. There’s a three-piece fiberglass paddle, a coiled leash, a two-speed double-action hand pump, a repair kit, and a sturdy wheeled backpack in this iSUP bundle.

This standard set of accessories is rounded out by two rod holders, a shoulder strap, and a SUP seat.

## [FlyCraft iSUP Fishing Package](https://www.flycraftusa.com/products/flycraft-stand-up-paddle-board-sup-fishing-package)

![](/SUPfishingpackage_2000x2000.webp)

### Overview

This is the kind of iSUP package that puts anglers in a flutter. It comes in at a steep price, but it has all the features to back up its price tag.

This light and extremely stable fishing paddleboard is perfect for fishing on large lakes, rivers, streams, and any other body of water where fishing is allowed. It measures ten feet two inches in length and 33.5 inches in width.

Seeing as this is a large board, you’ll have enough space on its full-size deck pad to land large catches and bring a pup, friend, or kid along. The weight limit is 300 pounds.

A set of bungee tie-downs at the nose of the board enables you to strap your items down, while the gear tower towards the tail of the board lets you store and organize your fishing rod and paddle. The gear tower also has a small zipper bag that provides extra storage space.

### Usability and durability

You won’t run out of D-rings on this paddleboard. It has a total of 23 D-rings, so you can add a kayak seat to it and any other compatible accessories.

One of the D-rings serves as a cooler mount, some of them link the tie-down straps, and the rest of them are there for you to use as you see fit. At the tail of the board you'll find an accessory port at the same spot where other board manufacturers would include another set of tie-downs.

This board comes with three fins, one large and two side bite fins, along with two gravity fins that are designed to improve tracking. Whenever the gravity fins hit an obstacle such as a rock, they pop up to allow you move forward, making this board an amazing watercraft for deep and shallow waters.

FlyCraft’s iSUP bundle includes an anchor system too that you can deploy when you find a fishing hotspot.

Two layers of drop-stitch PVC make up the board and provide the rigidity a fishing paddleboard needs to last long and withstand heavy use. The deck pad on top is comfortable and has great grip for unfaltering stability.

### Accessories

FlyCraft offers two fishing iSUP packages – the base package and the Profish package. The base package includes a board, a paddle, three removable fins, a hand pump, a repair kit, and a backpack. The Profish package comes with a gear tower, anchor system, gravity fins, and all the items in the base package.

## [Bote HD Aero Paddleboard](https://www.boteboard.com/collections/inflatable-paddle-boards/products/hd-aero-116-bug-slinger-bonefish-inflatable-paddle-board)

![](/116iHD22BS-photo-02-min.webp)

### Overview

The Bote HD Aero paddleboard has many of the same features as the Rackham Aero with a few differences.

Like all the products reviewed so far in this article, the HD Aero is a premium, lightweight paddleboard. It’s easy to inflate and deflate and feels rock-solid after inflation. If you’ve ever used a solid paddleboard, you won’t be able to tell the difference between this one and a solid board after it’s inflated!

The HD Aero has an entry rocker, a fancy name for an upward-facing nose whose purpose is to keep water off the board.

It has a weight capacity of 315 pounds that complements its 34 inches of horizontal room perfectly. Tracking is good thanks to its length (11 feet six inches) and the speed it offers is just perfect for SUP fishing.

The HD Aero has the same paddle sheath and front and rear bungee storage straps found on the Rackham Aero. It also has cooler tie-downs and paddle mount points.

### Usability and durability

Your feet need to stay in place while SUP fishing and that’s what the textured deck pad on this board sees to. The deck pad is sealed and nonabsorbent too and therefore helps to keep extra unwanted water weight off the board.

You can attach a kayak seat to the board using the D-rings on the side, keep your Magnepod-compatible accessories secure with the Magnepod, and attach compatible accessories using the action mounts.

The Rac receivers on this board give you the option of installing a Tackle Rac. The Tackle Rac is an optional accessory that serves as a paddle holder, fishing rod holder, and a handy stand to lean on while fishing.

With the aid of the three fins under the board, you can maneuver and turn easily despite its size. Only one of the fins is removable though.

Paddleboards get scraped, bumped into rocks, and experience a lot of other damaging occurrences. Bote’s military-grade PVC is extremely tough and that’s what makes the HD Aero almost indestructible. Toss it around and bump into as many rocks as you can, it will hold up well with minimal damage.

### Accessories

The HD Aero paddleboard is packaged with a three-piece adjustable paddle, a removable fin, a repair kit, a hand pump, and a backpack/travel bag. You also get a Sandspear sheath for attaching the Sandspear anchor, a paddle sheath, and a pair of Rac receivers.

## [Goture Inflatable Fishing Paddleboard](https://www.amazon.com/Goture-Inflatable-Backpack-Waterproof-Warranty/dp/B091JVDC6X/)

![](/71G4aZTgpdL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

### Overview

Goture’s fishing iSUP bundle is perfect for those that are new to SUP fishing. You don’t need to purchase any additional accessories for this board because it includes both the standard set of accessories you’ll find on most fishing iSUPs and the optional accessories that anglers buy.

Goture’s iSUP bundle contains an 11 feet board that is 33 inches wide and six inches thick. You could bring your kid or pet and all the gear you need and still not exceed its generous weight limit of 330 pounds.

There is one front and one rear set of bungee tie-down straps for strapping your belongings to the board and a camera mount to capture all the incredible catches and unforgettable fishing moments. The Goture board also has two fishing rod holders, one on either side of the board.

At first glance you’d think this iSUP bundle would cost a thousand dollars, but it will only set you back a little less than $500 while still offering most of the features and accessories that the higher-priced boards offer.

### Usability and durability

Another accessory that you won’t need to purchase if you buy this board is a SUP seat. The Goture iSUP bundle includes a nice SUP seat with a high backrest for low, mid, and high back support.

There are three fins under the board – two fixed side fins and one removable center fin. These fins do a great job of keeping the board stable and easing steering while traveling from one fishing spot to another.

The board is manufactured with two layers of military-grade PVC and double side walls for rigidity and durability. The exterior has a UV-resistant coating and a non-slip deck that not only serves to protect you from slipping but also protect the board from fish scrapes.

### Accessories

With this bundle you get the complete package. Goture’s bundle provides you with a fishing board, a shoulder strap, a hand pump, a three-piece aluminum paddle, a repair kit, a safety leash, two fishing rod holders, a SUP seat, and a backpack. I recommend upgrading to a carbon fiber paddle if you end up buying this bundle.

## Fishing iSUP vs regular iSUP vs boat

If you want to take fishing to a whole new level, you need a fishing paddleboard. You can’t just use a regular or cheap board because these boards don’t have the features that make fishing easy and comfortable on a paddleboard.

They are also not as durable as fishing boards. Fishing boards are built to withstand all sorts of fishing hazards, like landing a fish with a sharp spine, accidentally scraping or hitting the board with the tip of a hook, and more.

You can’t use a boat either because boats are susceptible to narrow rivers, difficult terrains, and fishing spots that are hard to reach.

Paddleboards allow you to navigate difficult terrains with more ease and make it to areas that are difficult to reach thanks to their auspicious designs.

They also have the added advantage of keeping you closer to the water which enables you to see fish through the water. This makes it easier to locate hotspots and land a lot of catches.

Another reason to fish on a board is the lower amount of noise they make compared to boats. This means boards won’t scare potential catches away like boats could. Add to that the ease of transporting a board and you’ll quickly realize that a paddleboard is the best watercraft for fishing.

## Features that make a fishing iSUP worth buying

1. **Width**: Width is probably the most important feature to look for because width equals stability, and stability is crucial when fishing. You’ll need it when riding the waters to your fishing spot and when trying to land an aggressive catch. Having enough width ensures you don’t fall into the water or tip over your gear while dealing with fighting fish.

Wide boards also give you enough room to store all your gear, accessories, and personal belongings and bring a pet or kid for company. I recommend anything from 32 inches and above. The wider it is, the more stable it will be.

2\. **Add-ons**: These are extra features that come with fishing iSUPs and that you won’t find on basic ones. The more of these your fishing iSUP has, the better your fishing experience.

I recommend getting a board that has action mounts for cameras, GPSes, and fishing rod holders; bungee tie-downs for neat storage; a cooler tie-down; and D-rings for attaching a kayak seat.

Of course, you may not need all of these, but one add-on you’ll definitely need is a mount for rod holders or a rack that comes with a rod holder. This is a must-have add-on for any fishing iSUP.

3\. **Ease of carrying**: Fishing iSUPs are wider, longer, and heavier than basic ones, so they need to be easy to carry. A good one will come with a handle that lets you grip it fully so you can have a firm hold.

Some boards also have shoulder straps that make them easier to carry. That said, good handles and shoulder straps only help with inflated boards. When the board is still in its backpack the only thing that can make carrying easier is wheels, so look for a wheeled backpack if you feel you might need that feature.

4\. **Extra addons**: The pricier fishing iSUPs offer extra features that you don’t need but would make your life easier if you had them. A good example is the Magnepod on Bote’s fishing boards that instantly secures compatible mugs and waterproof speakers to the board by magnetic force.

5\. **Sturdiness**: A fishing iSUP needs to be sturdy and rigid to survive mishaps involving sharp objects, like fish spines and fishing rods. Look for a board that has two or three layers of military-grade PVC. Get one with double air chambers too if you’re one for exploring uncharted waters as it can save your life.

6\. **Warranty**: A warranty is the only recourse you have when issues arise as a result of manufacturer defects. A good warranty will cover at least two years of use.

## Over to you

After reading this article, you probably have one question on your mind – which of these seven boards should I buy?

There’s only one answer to that question – these are all high-quality boards, so buy the one you can afford. Nixy, Sea Eagle, Bote, Glide, FlyCraft, and Goture are all excellent fishing iSUP brands.

Their boards tick all the right boxes for anglers, so any of these products is a good buy. However, if you’re a beginner, I recommend starting with the Goture board and gaining some experience with it on calm water lakes.

You can always upgrade to a pricier and more feature-rich board like the other six boards featured here after getting to the intermediate level.
