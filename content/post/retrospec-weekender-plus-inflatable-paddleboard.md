### 5/5

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Pros

* One of the lightest boards at this price point
* Easily transportable
* High quality accessories
* Tough enough for Dogs
* Suitable for the whole family

### Cons

* Not the most affordable SUP out there

I really loved this board straight away for its bold and uncompromising design.  The bright colors look even better than the photos in real life and it is really an amazing board to have if you want to get away on the weekends and explore the world around you.

The strength and durability of the materials used on the Retrospec Weekender Plus also show that it is

The only con of this board as I can see it is that there are more affordable boards available that will have similar performance at this level.

One of the main reasons for buying this SUP would be if you wanted an ultralight board that was tough enough to withstand blows against rocky shores
