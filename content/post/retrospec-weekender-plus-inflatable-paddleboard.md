In this post I will be taking a look at the Retrospec weekender plus inflatable SUP.

As the name suggests I think this is the perfect SUP for your weekends, it weighs an mere 17 lbs and supports a maximum weight of 275 lbs.  

What you are getting here is an ultra portable SUP that can be stored away in a small space in the back of the car and can travel with you where ever you chose to visit on your weekends.

The double layer PVC design means this is a strong board that will withstand most knocks.

It also comes with a dual action pump and a 3 part paddle  which can be dismantled. 

All the accessories are made to a high quality and they also have the benefit of being easily transportable.

## Retrospec Weekender Plus Inflatable Paddleboard - Who is it for?

The Retrospect SUP comes in five different colors or themes.  There really is everything for something in terms of the design choices here, which makes it a versatile board in terms of appearance choices.

I like the orange or “Creamsicle” color scheme.  It is a bright and fresh design, which I really love.

### What’s included in the box?

* Waterproof phone case
* 3 remova

## Features

* Designed for every excursion. 10' x 30" x 6" and can hold up to 275 lbs. Weighs an ultralight 17 lbs when inflated for easy transport.
* Topped with a textured and comfortable EVA deck for secure paddling while on deck. Plus, Weekender-10' is dog-friendly!
* Easily deflate and roll your board when not in use. When deflated and rolled, Weekender-10' measures at only 11"x36". Stash it anywhere from your Prius, your closet, to your garage.
* Constructed from durable, ArmorStrength PVC. A tough build means tough riding. Compared to traditional SUPs, Retrospec iSUPs fare better when in contact with rocks, shoals, and any dings that occur along the way.
* Includes everything you need to get your afloat. An adjustable lightweight paddle, carry bag, high-pressure dual action pump, removable fins, leash, and waterproof phone case.
