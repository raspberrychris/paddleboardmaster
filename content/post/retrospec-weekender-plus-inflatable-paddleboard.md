In this post I will be taking a look at the Retrospec weekender plus inflatable SUP.

What you are getting here is an ultra portable SUP that can be stored away in a small space in the back of the car and can travel with you where ever you chose to visit on your weekends.

The double layer PVC design means this is a strong board that will withstand most knocks and you can be safe in the knowledge that this is a secure SUP that won’t let you down!

It also comes with a dual action pump and a 3 part paddle  which can be dismantled. 

All the accessories are made to a high quality and they also have the benefit of being easily transportable.

## Retrospec Weekender Plus Inflatable Paddleboard - Who is it for?

The Retrospect SUP comes in five different colors or themes. (Creamsicle, Nautical Blue, Navy Zion, Seafoam Stripes & Wild Spruce). There really is something for everyone in terms of the design choices here, which makes it a versatile board in terms of appearance.

The SUP designs really are quite different and it is worth having a look at each one to ensure you get the one that you like.

I like the orange or “Creamsicle” color scheme.  It is a bright and fresh design, which I really love.

As the name suggests I think this is the perfect SUP for your weekends, it weighs an mere 17 lbs and supports a maximum weight of 275 lbs.  

### What’s included in the box?

* Waterproof phone case

## Features

* Designed for every excursion. 10' x 30" x 6" and can hold up to 275 lbs. Weighs an ultralight 17 lbs when inflated for easy transport.
* Topped with a textured and comfortable EVA deck for secure paddling while on deck. Plus, Weekender-10' is dog-friendly!
