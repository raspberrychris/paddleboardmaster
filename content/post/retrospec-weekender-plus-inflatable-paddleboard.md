In this post I will be taking a look at the Retrospec weekender plus inflatable SUP.

As the name suggests this is the perfect SUP for your weekends.

## Retrospec Weekender Plus Inflatable Paddleboard - Who is it for?

## Features

* Designed for every excursion. 10' x 30" x 6" and can hold up to 275 lbs. Weighs an ultralight 17 lbs when inflated for easy transport.
* Topped with a textured and comfortable EVA deck for secure paddling while on deck. Plus, Weekender-10' is dog-friendly!
* Easily deflate and roll your board when not in use. When deflated and rolled, Weekender-10' measures at only 11"x36". Stash it anywhere from your Prius, your closet, to your garage.
* Constructed from durable, ArmorStrength PVC. A tough build means tough riding. Compared to traditional SUPs, Retrospec iSUPs fare better when in contact with rocks, shoals, and any dings that occur along the way.
* Includes everything you need to get your afloat. An adjustable lightweight paddle, carry bag, high-pressure dual action pump, removable fins, leash, and waterproof phone case.
