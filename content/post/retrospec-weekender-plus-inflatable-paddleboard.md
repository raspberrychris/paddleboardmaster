In this post I will be taking a look at the Retrospec weekender plus inflatable SUP.  The Retrospec is an ultralight portable board that you can really take anywhere with you with out any hassle and this is one its major selling points.

Scroll down to hear more about my honest opinion of the Retrospec Weekender Plus Inflatable Paddleboard and see how it compares to other paddleboards on the market.

What you are getting here is an ultra portable SUP that can be stored away in a small space in the back of the car and can travel with you where ever you chose to visit on your weekends.

The double layer PVC design means this is a strong board that will withstand most knocks and you can be safe in the knowledge that this is a secure SUP that won’t let you down when you come into contact with the rocky shores.

It also comes with a dual action pump and a 3 part paddle  which can be dismantled.

All the accessories are made to a high quality and they also have the benefit of being easily transportable.

## Retrospec Weekender Plus Inflatable Paddleboard - Who is it for?

The Retrospect SUP comes in five different colors or themes. (Creamsicle, Nautical Blue, Navy Zion, Seafoam Stripes & Wild Spruce). There really is something for everyone in terms of the design choices here, which makes it a versatile board in terms of appearance.

The SUP designs really are quite different and it is worth having a look at each one to ensure you get the one that you like.
