### **It’s a great beginners board**

One of the key strengths of this paddleboard, apart from the fact that it is great for beginners and is at a great price point, is that it is a very steady board that can support up to 330lbs, which is around 1-2 people, or a single person and a pet.  (We don’t encourage people to take their pets on paddleboards, but we know that some people do like to do this with well trained animals).

The [**Lucear Inflatable paddleboard**](#) also thoughtfully has a leash that can be attached to your leg if you are a beginner to paddleboarding and want to ensure your safety.

Another useful feature is the surface of the Lucear paddleboard is textured and means that it is non slip, which makes it a perfect board for those who are looking to do activities such as Yoga, fishing or just general sightseeing where a bit of grip is required.

In my own tests I have had no trouble using this paddleboard on a wide range of water - you can even use it in the ocean as well as lakes or rivers.

## Features:

### Wide Design with non slip surface

The wide and thick inflatable stand up paddle board is 100’’*30’_*6’’_

It is easy for maintaining steady and safe sailing. It has a large EVA cushioned deck with a patterned design increases both comfort and friction (anti-slip).
