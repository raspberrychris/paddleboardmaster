In this post I will be taking the [**Hapfan Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard**](https://www.amazon.com/Hapfan-Inflatable-Stand-Paddle-Board/dp/B09GTZ6L4Q?ie=UTF8&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=paddleboardmaster-20&linkId=6145e4809fb7c67799d016293f115169&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) through its paces and understanding why this is one of the most popular paddleboards of this year so far!

If that interests you, then read on!

## What I noticed First: Great Design & Good Quality Accessories

One thing that you will instantly notice about this paddleboard is the awesome design. 

The plant inspired look creates a really cool laid back aesthetic and is perfect for trips out in the wilderness or your nearest lake.

Even if the plant inspired look isn’t your jam, [**Hapfan**](/categories/hapfan/) offer this paddleboard in another more traditional blue colour, which I actually really like.

Another cool thing with this board and the color variations is that the bag is designed in the style of the color choice that you pick.  The attention to detail with this paddleboard is high.

If you are concerned about design, the blue variation offers the most color co-ordinated set, which almost everything in Blue color.

### It Comes with an Electric Pump that Takes the Stress Out of Setting Up

One of the more unique things about this particular paddleboard is the fact that it comes included with an electric pump.  

**Yes, you read that right, an ELECTRIC pump!**

In our tests it took around 7-8 minutes to inflate and 4 minutes to deflate (all with no stress).

This is actually one of the first electric pumps included with a paddleboard that I have reviewed and was very impressed by its performance and how easy it was compared to the more traditional manual pumping.

If you are not a fan of manual pumping, and lets face it - who is these days, then you will love how easy this paddleboard is to set up, meaning you can spend more time on the water.

You can also connect the electric pump to a mobile power bank or a cigarette lighter on your vehicle, meaning you can be on the water in minutes with no sweat!

## Verdict

### 5/5

### Pros

* Electric Pump means you can spend more time on the water!
* Great styling
* Wide and Sturdy Board suitable for all

### Cons

* One user has reported of a broken paddle

This really is an exceptional board for the money and we have given this board 5/5.  The accessories are higher quality than most other boards in this class, for example, with a lot of boards you are lucky to get a manual pump, so an electric pump is a real bonus and a thoughtful accessory.

The paddleboard itself has thoughtful styling and is suitable for a wide range of people and activities. It can support up to 350lbs (which is around about 2 adults).

It is a sturdy and fun board to use and would make a great board for beginners and more experienced paddleboarders alike.

The materials on the board are high quality and there aren’t really that many cons of this paddleboard in our opinion.  

I only noticed one negative  review that mentioned that the paddle had had some problems for a particular customer.  I would assume that this is an isolated case, but something to be aware of.

Overall the Hapfan paddleboard works just as well as a plastic or fibreglass board, but with the advantage that at the end of the day you can quickly deflate it with the electric pump and pack it away with out any hassle.
