In this post I will be taking the [**Hapfan Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard**](#) through its paces and understanding why this is one of the most popular paddleboards of this year so far!

If that interests you, read on!

## Great Design & Accessories

One thing that you will instantly notice about this paddleboard is the design. The plant inspired design creates a really cool laid back aesthetic and is perfect for trips out in the wilderness or your nearest lake.

Even if the green plant inspired design isnâ€™t your jam, Hapfan offer this paddleboard in another more traditional blue colour, which I really like as well.

### An Electric Pump Takes the Stress Out of Setting Up

One of the more unique things about this particular paddleboard is the fact that it comes included with an electric pump.  

In our tests it took around 7-8 minutes to inflate and 4 minutes to deflate (all with no stress).

This is actually one of the first electric pumps included with a paddleboard that I have reviewed and was very impressed by its performance and how easy it was compared to the more traditional manual pumping.

If you are not a fan of manual pumping, and lets face it - who is these days, then you will love how easy this paddleboard is to set up, so you can spend more time on the water.

You can also connect the electric pump to a mobile power bank or a cigarette lighter on your vehicle, meaning you can be on the water in minutes with no sweat!
