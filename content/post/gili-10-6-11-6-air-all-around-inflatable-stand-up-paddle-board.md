## GILI 10'6/11'6 AIR All Around Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

![Gili-who-is-it-for](/uploads/585155f8-e2a9-4c29-83bd-0f1ecba86e77.jpeg "Gili-who-is-it-for")

I’m going to jump straight in with the elephant in the room:  This is not the best value paddleboard out there, but in my opinion it represents good value for money if you are looking for a high performance SUP that is lighter than a traditional hard board.

The board itself packs away into the provided bag and is flight safe, fits in to your car or pick up and can be stored easily away in your house when not in use.

In terms of design and colors you can get two variations the blue (pictured) or a Camo version.  We like both designs, but I think the blue is our favorite.

### Extra Wide design

The width of the GILI has been extended to 32 inches to provide the ultimate stability when out on the water.  This is really going to be important if you are looking for a paddleboard that you need for activities that require a certain degree of stability such as fishing or Yoga for example.

### Quick Deflation and Inflation

![Gili-inflates-in-10-minutes](/uploads/b981d37d-3e02-4d4c-b0a6-6855d086914f.jpeg "Gili-inflates-in-10-minutes")

If you are looking for a SUP that is quick to deflate then it might be worth taking a look at the [**GILI**](/categories/gili/), which deflates in around 5-10 minutes, this is a fast time and you can re-inflate it to around 12-15 PSI when you need to use it.

### How to deflate the GILI:

* Make sure the board is dry and dust-fre
* Slowly, push down on the valve pin, and turn clockwise until the pin is locked in the DOWN position.
* When your board is completely deflated, make sure the valve pin is in the closed (UP) position by turning the valve pin counter-clockwise and the valve pops up.
* Remove the fins before you roll up your board.

## Verdict

![Gili-on-beach](/uploads/b5ffede0-712c-4c47-91ad-289fbab4e4fc.jpeg "Gili-on-beach")

## 4/5

## Pros

* Super Lightweight transportable board
* Easy to Inflate
* Good Quality Board
* Good alternative to a hard board

## Cons

* Made in China

We think this is a great board for someone who has an existing hard board but wants something that they can use on the weekends.

It is a little less affordable than some of the other SUPs that we have reviewed, but the quality of the materials and the overall package is extremely good.

The only negative point that we could find really was that this SUP is not made in the US.  It is actually made in China, contrary to some of the listings of this product on the internet.

One of the things that makes this inflatable paddle board quite special is the quality of the accessories and how they fit together to be one overall package.  Also the weight of the board is just 19lbs.  Considering most SUPs weigh 25lbs this is a considerable reduction.

Lastly, you will likely need an electric pump to pump up this SUP.

We hope you enjoyed this review, let us know what you think of this SUP in the comments.
