Quick Deflation

If you are looking for a SUP that is quick to deflate then it might be worth taking a look at the GILI which deflates in around 5-10 minutes 

### How to deflate:

* Make sure the board is dry and dust-fre
* Slowly, push down on the valve pin, and turn clockwise until the pin is locked in the DOWN position.
* When your board is completely deflated, make sure the valve pin is in the closed (UP) position by turning the valve pin counter-clockwise and the valve pops up.
* Remove the fins before you roll up your board.
