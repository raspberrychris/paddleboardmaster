My only complaints so far are more of wish list items that I will probably end up adding myself. d-rings in the back to add an additional bungee for storage.

I spent a lot of time staring at this paddleboard in my Amazon cart, then decided to just go for it, and I'm so glad I did! It was easier to pump up that I thought it would be, only took about 5-6 minutes, same for deflating. Everything packs away easily in the backpack, which is pretty huge but not hard for an average sized woman to carry on her back. This was my very first time on a paddle board so I have no comparison, but I felt the board was pretty sturdy and I was able to balance myself with what I feel was just the right amount of effort. The board looks great and materials feel durable. It's super long and wide so I felt comfortable laying back and relaxing too. I love all the D rings and bungees to attach a dry bag or cooler, and plan on purchasing a seat in the near future as well. I love my new toy and I'm glad I decided to splurge.

The board got hot in the sun while blowing it up in 95 degree weather and when I went to go pick it up and used the handle, the handle pulled apart from the board pulling some pieces of the grip foam off with it because I guess the glue didn\\u2019t like the heat.

I ordered it for my daughter. We will be returning our second board real soon. The handle of the first one ripped off the fist time she used it. We have a weekend of trips planned so she struggled with carrying it the second night. Well the second night, it started leaking around the seal of the filling nozzle. This doesn\\u2019t make you comfortable when you plan a trip in Central Florida (gator country). So I chatted with Amazon. They sent us a replacement in a couple of days. We planned to take the board out the night we received the new one. Well guess what?!?! The second board leaks are from the same spot but even worse than the first. We will be returning it this time for a refund and looking for a new company to purchase from.

It comes in its own carrying bag. The bag is the only mildly negative thing about the board, it's not as large or durable as our bag for our other board but it works. The board can fit back into the bag but it's super tight and after a few trips with it it already has a few thinning areas in the material. The board itself and the rest of the gear that comes with it is great. The board is solid and looks great. It inflates easy enough with the pump supplied. The pump is great and seems like a well made product. In fact, I also use it on my other board. The portability and ease of storing is amazing. Over all this is a great portable SUP.", "review_title": "Love this SUP!

Needed something that would fit in the trunk of my small vehicle. This fit perfect.
