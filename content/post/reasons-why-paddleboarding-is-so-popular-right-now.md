So why exactly has paddleboarding become such a popular sport and one of the most searched for on the internet?

There are many reasons for Paddleboarding's impressive growth in recent years.  I have put together a list of some of the top reasons that I believe paddleboarding has become a go-to sport for many people around the world.

## 1. Everyone can get involved in (SUP) paddleboarding

Paddleboarding is a sport that everyone can get involved in, your whole family (including the dog!) can all get involved and you can explore the world together on your paddleboards. One of the great things about paddleboarding is that it is very easy to get to grips with and it has a universal appeal with children and adults alike!

## 2. Paddleboarding can improve your health! 

From a physical healthy perspective SUP paddleboarding gives you a great workout, it helps strengthen your core and keen your cardiovascular health in check.  On a mental health perspective paddleboarding can provide you with a good way to release stress from your life and become more connected to the outside world and nature around you.  If you need to unwind, replenish and relax then paddleboarding can certainly help improve your overall fitness both mentally and physically.

## 3. Paddleboarding is no longer expensive

There is a false perception among some people that Paddleboarding is an expensive hobby only available to the rich.  This is however far from true and since the introduction of inflatable paddleboards prices of high quality SUPs have become extremely affordable. Inflatable SUPs also have a distinct advantage in that they can be easily stored away when not in use and transported in a backpack.

You no longer need a pickup, roof rack or any other expensive equipment to get into this sport.  If you are happy to part with a few hundred dollars then you can get a few high quality board, with every accessory you will need included.

REASON #3: Paddleboarding is very affordable.

Far from being a sport that is only accessible to wealthy individuals, stand up paddleboarding is a truly affordable activity that anyone can enjoy. SUP doesn’t require expensive lift tickets, high-priced travel arrangements, or costly gear to participate. Inflatable paddle boards are less expensive than hard boards and since they pack down to a fraction of their size, you don’t need a roof rack or any special equipment to travel with them. With a travel bag, included with any of our SUP package, you can literally paddle anywhere in the world.

REASON #4: SUP is a great activity for socializing.

Thanks to the sport’s mass appeal, there are an endless number of local paddling clubs, meet-ups, and events that make it super easy to make new friends. Whether you’re a dog owner, river SUP enthusiast, advocate for ocean cleanup and conservation, or fitness buff, there are plenty of local outlets for meeting like-minded people who share your interests.

REASON #5: Surf culture without the need for surf.

The surf industry’s trendy, laid back culture is undeniably contagious, but the vast majority of people can’t participate due to the fact that it is centered around surf breaks and beach life. Stand up paddleboarding is much more accessible to people anywhere and the culture is comparable. — as long as you’re within driving distance of water, you can enjoy SUP’s fun lifestyle. Additionally, SUP is much easier to get started than surfing which takes lots of practice.

A paddle board will allow you to explore stunningly beautiful areas that would be otherwise inaccessible. The sights you’ll experience while paddling are simply breathtaking.

REASON #7: Paddleboarding is a fun way to lose weight.

If you’re tired of fad diets, non-effective weight loss supplements, and expensive gym memberships, stand up paddleboarding will be right up your alley. SUP is a fantastic activity for burning fat and losing weight. Plus, it’s far more enjoyable than spending the afternoon in a crowded gym.
