**So why exactly has paddleboarding become such a popular sport and one of the most searched for on the internet?**

There are many reasons for Paddleboarding's impressive growth in recent years.  I have put together a list of some of the top reasons that I believe paddleboarding has become a go-to sport for many people around the world.

## 1. Everyone can get involved in (SUP) paddleboarding

Paddleboarding is a sport that everyone can get involved in, your whole family (including the dog!) can all get involved and you can explore the world together on your paddleboards. One of the great things about paddleboarding is that it is very easy to get to grips with and it has a universal appeal with children and adults alike!

## 2. Paddleboarding can improve your health! 

From a physical healthy perspective SUP paddleboarding gives you a great workout, it helps strengthen your core and keen your cardiovascular health in check.  On a mental health perspective paddleboarding can provide you with a good way to release stress from your life and become more connected to the outside world and nature around you.  If you need to unwind, replenish and relax then paddleboarding can certainly help improve your overall fitness both mentally and physically.

## 3. Paddleboarding is no longer expensive

There is a false perception among some people that Paddleboarding is an expensive hobby only available to the rich.  This is however far from true and since the introduction of inflatable paddleboards prices of high quality SUPs have become extremely affordable. Inflatable SUPs also have a distinct advantage in that they can be easily stored away when not in use and transported in a backpack.

You no longer need a pickup, roof rack or any other expensive equipment to get into this sport.  If you are happy to part with a few hundred dollars then you can get a few high quality board, with every accessory you will need included.

## 4. Paddleboarding is a naturally social sport

With everyone out on the water together its inevitable that you will bump into lots of new people with similar interests, some of which might even become your new friends!  One of the great things about paddleboarding is that there is a strong community of likeminded people and wherever you are in the world you are never too far away from a SUP club or meetup.

## 5. Accessibility 

The accessibility of paddleboarding and the fact that almost anyone can get involved in it and have fun straight away, is one of the things that I believe has propelled it to increased popularity in recent years.  It can be a solitary activity where you explore the world on your own and unwind, or it can be a group activity where you navigate together as a unit of either family or friends.  

The bottom line is that anyone can get involved in paddleboarding and that is what makes it so fun.  Unlike surfing for example, which has a higher boundary for entry paddleboarding is a much more accessible sport than surfing without the high boundary for getting involved and having fun.

## 6. Paddleboarding is the best way to explore the water and the outdoors

Some of the lakes in the US and around the world are unbelievably beautiful and full of jaw dropping scenery.  Exploring the world by paddleboard can give you a whole new perspective on the world and seeing the world from the water gives you a whole new view.

## 7. Paddleboarding can assist in Weight loss 

Paddleboarding is not the most extremely active sport out there, but it is one that over time can help you maintain your weight and help fight the flab!  If you are looking for a low to medium intensity sport that doesn't involve running on a treadmill in a Gym staring at the clock, then you may be interested to try Paddleboarding.

## 8. Paddleboarding creates great opporunties for videos and photography

If you are a video or photography enthusiast then you will discover that paddleboarding can open up a whole new level of photographic and filming opportunities when you are exploring.  

When you are out on the water exploring the world, you get a unique perspective and this is something that is very hard to re-create any other way.  This provides lots of creative opportunities for you to share your passion for the water and exploration with other people (All while having loads of fun paddleboarding)!
