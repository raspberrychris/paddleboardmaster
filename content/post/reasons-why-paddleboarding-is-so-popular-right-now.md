So why exactly has paddleboarding become such a popular sport and one of the most searched for on the internet?

There are many reasons for Paddleboarding's impressive growth in recent years.  I have put together a list of some of the top reasons that I believe paddleboarding has become a go-to sport for many people around the world.

1. Everyone can get involved in paddleboarding

Paddleboarding is a sport that everyone can get involved in, your whole family (including the dog) can all get involved and you can explore the world together.

In this article, we’ll take a look at 7 top reasons why the sport of stand up paddleboarding is growing at such a rapid pace. While there are obviously many other contributing factors to the sport’s impressive growth, the following list includes several of the major ones that we’ve personally taken note of over the years.

REASON #1: SUP is something the whole family can enjoy.

Paddleboarding is a family-friendly activity that all ages and skill levels can enjoy. It’s an incredibly easy sport to pick up and something that children love just as much as seniors. If you’re looking for a great way to spend an afternoon with the family, SUP is a wonderful choice!

REASON #2: Stand up paddleboarding has numerous health benefits.

In addition to providing outstanding physical health benefits, SUP is also great for mental health. Physically, paddleboarding gives you a great full-body workout. It’s an excellent activity for cardiovascular health and core strengthening. Mentally, it provides an effective outlet for stress management. Paddleboarding allows you to unplug from the stresses of daily life and gives you access to scenic, serene paddling spots. There’s no better way to refresh and recharge.

REASON #3: Paddleboarding is very affordable.

Far from being a sport that is only accessible to wealthy individuals, stand up paddleboarding is a truly affordable activity that anyone can enjoy. SUP doesn’t require expensive lift tickets, high-priced travel arrangements, or costly gear to participate. Inflatable paddle boards are less expensive than hard boards and since they pack down to a fraction of their size, you don’t need a roof rack or any special equipment to travel with them. With a travel bag, included with any of our SUP package, you can literally paddle anywhere in the world.

REASON #4: SUP is a great activity for socializing.

Thanks to the sport’s mass appeal, there are an endless number of local paddling clubs, meet-ups, and events that make it super easy to make new friends. Whether you’re a dog owner, river SUP enthusiast, advocate for ocean cleanup and conservation, or fitness buff, there are plenty of local outlets for meeting like-minded people who share your interests.

REASON #5: Surf culture without the need for surf.

The surf industry’s trendy, laid back culture is undeniably contagious, but the vast majority of people can’t participate due to the fact that it is centered around surf breaks and beach life. Stand up paddleboarding is much more accessible to people anywhere and the culture is comparable. — as long as you’re within driving distance of water, you can enjoy SUP’s fun lifestyle. Additionally, SUP is much easier to get started than surfing which takes lots of practice.

REASON #6: It’s a great way to explore the outdoors.

If exploring the outdoors is your thing, stand up paddleboarding will give you unparalleled access to some of the most amazing spots in existence. A paddle board will allow you to explore stunningly beautiful areas that would be otherwise inaccessible. The sights you’ll experience while paddling are simply breathtaking.

REASON #7: Paddleboarding is a fun way to lose weight.

If you’re tired of fad diets, non-effective weight loss supplements, and expensive gym memberships, stand up paddleboarding will be right up your alley. SUP is a fantastic activity for burning fat and losing weight. Plus, it’s far more enjoyable than spending the afternoon in a crowded gym.
