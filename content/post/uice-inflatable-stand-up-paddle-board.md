**Right, let‚Äôs get into this!**

## UICE Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

If you are looking for a super stable paddleboard then this will be a really good option for you, this is one of the most stable boards I have reviewed, so it would be perfect for activities such as Yoga, Fishing or general exploring.

[![Uice-paddleboard-kids-pets](/uploads/uice-paddleboard-kids-pets.jpg "Uice-paddleboard-kids-pets")](https://www.amazon.com/UICE-Inflatable-Advanced-Standard-Accessories/dp/B09PG1GKPT?c=ts&keywords=Stand-Up+Paddleboards&qid=1655818653&refinements=p_89%3AUICE&s=sports-and-fitness&sr=1-2&ts_id=5522381011&linkCode=ll1&tag=paddleboardmaster-20&linkId=bdb471e119579ab44c1291ebad0a6996&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

The [**Uice**](/categories/uice/) has an anti slip deck as well enables you to stand easily and not slip, perfect for activities where stability is really required, as we mentioned this is perfect if you are into activities like Yoga or Fishing.

Another great aspect of this SUP is that children, teenagers and adults alike will be fully supported on this board, as it supports up to 374lbs (170kg).

This SUP is also great for riding with pets as the material is strong and durable and won‚Äôt easily rip or tear.

> One of the best things about this paddleboard is that the included pump that you get with the Uice Inflatable SUP, enables you to inflate and deflate the paddleboard in 3 minutes.  This is very fast! (Even when compared to some of the more expensive paddleboards we have reviewed).

## Verdict

## 4/5

## ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

## Pros

‚úÖ Fantastic SUP if you have kids or pets as it is extremely stable

‚úÖ Great design - with UV-Printing means that it won‚Äôt lose its vibrancy over time

## Cons

‚ùå Not as wide as some other boards

The materials used and the way the board is put together really mean it is is a great deal, even though it is a little bit less affordable than some of the other boards out there.

If you are looking for a wide board - and this is a particular focus for you, you will find that this SUP is actually a little less wide than your typical paddleboard.

If this is a deal breaker, then you may want to look at some of our other paddleboard reviews to find a wider board.

One of my favourite things about this SUP is the UV printing.  I mean - it is my favorite thing about this board!

This really is a step above most of the other boards out there, and it means that the design that you get on the board is not going to fade away.  This means that this board from UICE really is going to last, and even though you are paying a little bit more here, I think this is one of the better investments if you are looking for a SUP that you can keep in the longer term.
