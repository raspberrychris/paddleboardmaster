**Right, letâ€™s get into this!**

## UICE Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

If you are looking for a super stable paddleboard then this will be a really good option for you, this is one of the most stable boards I have reviewed, so it would be perfect for activities such as Yoga, Fishing or general exploring.

The [**Uice**](/categories/uice/) has an anti slip deck as well enables you to stand easily and not slip, perfect for activities where stability is really required, as we mentioned this is perfect if you are into activities like Yoga or Fishing.

Another great aspect of this SUP is that children, teenagers and adults alike will be fully supported on this board, as it supports up to 374lbs (170kg).

This SUP is also great for riding with pets as the material is strong and durable and wonâ€™t easily rip or tear.

> One of the best things about this paddleboard is that the included pump that you get with the Uice Inflatable SUP, enables you to inflate and deflate the paddleboard in 3 minutes.  This is very fast! (Even when compared to some of the more expensive paddleboards we have reviewed).
