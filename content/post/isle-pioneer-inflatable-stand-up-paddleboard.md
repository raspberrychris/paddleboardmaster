We have looked at a lot of high quality paddleboards in our reviews, but this next Paddleboard From ISLE, is one of our favourites out there.

If you haven’t heard of ISLE before you may want to hear about who they are.

ISLE started as two San Diego surfers, Marc Miller and Doug Pate who followed their passion and grew a paddleboard business from 2004 that started in their parents storage unit.

They are now one of the most premium paddleboard companies in the world and have a 15,000 square foot retail store in San Diego.

I am a big fan of the design of the boards and although they are a bit pricier than some of the other boards we have reviewed on here, the attention to detail on their paddleboards is unmatched.
