We have looked at a lot of high quality paddleboards in our reviews, but this next Paddleboard From [**ISLE**](/categories/isle/), is one of our favourites out there.

If you haven’t heard of ISLE before you may want to hear about who is behind this company and their story of how they got started.

ISLE started as two San Diego surfers, Marc Miller and Doug Pate who followed their passion and grew a paddleboard business from 2004 that started in their parents storage unit.

They are now one of the most premium paddleboard companies in the world and have a 15,000 square foot retail store in San Diego, US.

## ISLE Pioneer Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it For?

I am a big fan of the design of the boards and although they are a bit pricier than some of the other boards we have reviewed on [**paddleboardmaster.com**](/), the attention to detail on their paddleboards is unmatched.

Everything from the design of the boards to the accessories are very nicely done here and if you want something that is going to last this is also an excellent choice.  The quality of the materials used on the board is also fantastic.

The [**Isle Pioneer paddleboard**](#) is described by the company itself as being suitable for beginners and all riders.  It has a rider weight of 285lbs and is best used on flat water or ocean paddling.

The board uses military grade PVC, so you can be assured that you are getting a high performance paddleboard.

You can use this SUP for a wide range of activities.  ISLE recommend that this board is however best suited to the below activities:

* All-around paddling
* Yoga and fitness
* Fishing
* Pet-friendly paddling
* SUP surfing

We think this paddleboard with its wide stance would be great if you are into Yoga or wanted to paddle with your pet.

## Verdict

### 5/5

Wow! What a fantastic board! I really found it hard to find anything bad about the ISLE pioneer, and that is reflected in my rating of this paddleboard.

If you are after a premium board then we think this offers the whole package.  You get quality accessories, a great high quality board made from the best materials.  

The design and style of the board is definitely market leading and the fact that it has been designed by two surfers really shows that they know the market and what people want.

This is another board that has great attention to detail in the styling and shape of the board.  

It is suitable for a wide range of activities and really any one would be suitable using it.

As it is an inflatable paddleboard you can pack it all away and take it with you where ever you go.  The thing that seperates this paddleboard from some of the other paddleboards that we have looked at is I feel that this board will last a bit longer than the average paddleboard.

The only negative that we can see is that it is more pricier than some of the other boards out there, but if you are looking for something that you can keep long term and from a company that has great values, then you will definitely love this paddleboard.
