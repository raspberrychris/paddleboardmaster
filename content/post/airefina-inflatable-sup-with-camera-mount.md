**Ok right, let's get started!**

## Airefina Inflatable SUP with Camera Mount  - Who is it for?

![airefina-inflatable-sup-yoga-woman](/uploads/backgrounds.jpg "airefina-inflatable-sup-yoga-woman")

The [**Airefina**](/categories/airefina/) is one of the top new inflatable paddleboards of 2022 so far.

We have been very impressed with its instant popularity with all different types of people, both young and old.

**But what is it EXACTLY that people really love about this SUP?!**

The sturdiness, durability of the materials and the fact that it is really easy to inflate came out as the top reasons why customers who bought this paddleboard really loved it and would recommend it to others.

Also the fact that it "literally comes with everything you need" is an absolute bonus here, especially at this price point.

I would almost go as far as to say I am not sure how they are doing this for the money.

## Final Verdict

Well, what can I say...

We absolutely love this paddleboard from Airefina!

I think that this board really does provide great value for money and almost gives you the hard board experience at a much more affordable price point.

> The sturdiness of the board coupled with the fact that it is lightweight comparatively and portable make this the perfect option for your weekend getaway to the lakes or the coast!

This means that this paddleboard will enable a lot more people to enjoy exploring on their SUP, which we think is a great thing for paddleboarding.

The only negative thing we could find about this particular SUP was the fact that it is a relatively new brand and it may put some people off it for this reason, but if that doesn't bother you then this is an excellent choice of paddleboard in our opinion.
