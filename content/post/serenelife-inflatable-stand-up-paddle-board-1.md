If you are searching for an SUP with a difference then you are in the right place!

This SUP has a completely unique design, which I absolutely love and couldn’t wait to get my hands on it to test it out.

If you want to make a statement on the water, then there really is no better way to do it than with a board with a graffiti inspired design like this one.

## SereneLife inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

If you are looking for a paddleboard with a unique design, that is light and good quality then you are likely to be interested in this SUP.  

It is a paddleboard that can be used by beginners right up to the more advanced.  It is a wide, stable board that can be used by anyone of any age.

As it is inflatable it is a great SUP that you can pack away and throw in the car after you have finished paddleboarding.

In terms of set up is is also very simple and you don’t need any special experience to set up the board, everything is very self explanatory.

This SUP has two thoughtful features which I really love.  

Firstly it has an action camera or GoPro holder.  This makes it easy to secure your camera to the board, so you can record your adventures without having to be concerned about losing your camera.

Secondly this SUP also comes with a water proof cellphone holder which is included in the accessories.

All the usual safety features are included and you also get a repair kit included, which is useful if you were to damage the board.

### What is the quality of the materials like?

The board itself has drop stitch reinforced PVC.  Making it water proof and resistant to corrosion.  Like some of the other SUPs I have reviewed the quality level is described as “Military grade”.  The paddleboard also has a UV resistant coating.  It also features double layer fabric and space yarn.
