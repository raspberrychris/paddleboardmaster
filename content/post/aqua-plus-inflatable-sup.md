Welcome to this article today I will be taking a look at the [**Aqua Plus Inflatable SUP paddleboard.**](https://www.amazon.com/Aqua-Plus-Inflatable-Backpack-Shoulder/dp/B07PLXK7WL?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=paddleboardmaster-20&linkId=89e5e6a45844be45e876190dd8fc55f2&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) Join me as I take an indepth look at this paddleboard to see how it compares against similar products in the market.

We have had many requests to review this board and people have praised the fact that it is easy to inflate, comes with with a high quality pump, is well made and is light to carry.

**Right, with out any further ado lets get stuck into the review!**

## Aqua Plus Inflatable SUP - Who is it for?

[**Aqua Plus**](/categories/aqua-plus/) describe this paddleboard as a paddleboard for ‚Äúwater fun, fitness and frolic‚Äù.  This rather formal description of the board basically means its a lot of fun!

If you like having fun, then the chances are you will probably like this SUP!

This board is very transportable its weight is just 20lbs and it can be stored in the backpack and is also falls under the limit for checked luggage so you can take it on an airplane without any hassle.  The maximum capacity for the Aqua Plus Inflatable SUP is 330lbs, so it is stable and can suit a number of different types of people.

This SUP is suitable for both fresh water and salt water, so wherever you want to use it you can.

The double action pump is actually really fast way to inflate and deflate this paddleboard.

I would describe this SUP as one that is a perfect entry level paddleboard.  If you are looking to get into paddleboarding then you will find everything you need in this package to get going and really have some fun on the water.  Another great thing about this SUP is that the tough materials make it great if you want to take your dog with you.

If you are looking for onboard storage as well there is a bungee cord at the front of the board where you can store your things.

### 4/5

### Pros

* Great entry level board suitable for beginners

### Cons

* There are better SUPs out there

* Pump does not show PSI

Overall I think that the Aqua Plus Inflatable SUP is a really good package for anyone that is new to paddleboarding or looking for a new hobby and it is hard not to give it a good rating.  There are only a few issues where it falls short and I have mentioned those above.

**Great things:** The paddleboard is light, comes with a lot of accessories and is very stable.

The [**Aqua Plus**](/categories/aqua-plus/) Inflatable SUP also inflates and deflates very quickly so if you don‚Äôt like hanging around this is a great choice.  And if you are worried about the SUP losing pressure, you won‚Äôt have to as this board keeps its pressure very well compared to some of the other SUPs that we have reviewed.

The 1 year warranty with this SUP will also give you peace of mind when it comes to any potential damage you may incur whilst out and about on the water.  I think that the materials used on this board are actually really high quality and many of the reviews online actually discuss the fact that they have had their dogs on the [**Aqua Plus**](/categories/aqua-plus/) with no issues.
