We have had many requests to review this board and people have praised the fact that it is easy to inflate, comes with with a high quality pump, is well made and is light to carry.

**Right, with out any further ado lets get stuck into the review!**

# Aqua Plus Inflatable SUP - Who is it for?

[**Aqua Plus**](/categories/aqua-plus/) describe this paddleboard as a paddleboard for ‚Äúwater fun, fitness and frolic‚Äù.  This rather formal description of the board basically means its a lot of fun!

If you like having fun, then the chances are you will probably like this SUP!

This board is very transportable its weight is just 20lbs and it can be stored in the backpack and is also falls under the limit for checked luggage so you can take it on an airplane without any hassle.  The maximum capacity for the Aqua Plus Inflatable SUP is 330lbs, so it is stable and can suit a number of different types of people.

This SUP is suitable for both fresh water and salt water, so wherever you want to use it you can.

The double action pump is actually really fast way to inflate and deflate this paddleboard.

I would describe this SUP as one that is a perfect entry level paddleboard.  If you are looking to get into paddleboarding then you will find everything you need in this package to get going and really have some fun on the water.  Another great thing about this SUP is that the tough materials make it great if you want to take your dog with you.

If you are looking for onboard storage as well there is a bungee cord at the front of the board where you can store your things.
