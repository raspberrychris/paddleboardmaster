Welcome to this review, today I will be taking a look at the Drift Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board and walking you through the features, who it's for and seeing how it really performs on the water.

Join us as I take an in depth look at this paddleboard to see how it compares against similar paddleboards in the market.  

We will take a look at the pros and cons of this board and provide an ultimate score for how we think this board performs overall.

## Drift Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board - Who is it for?

Drift say that this paddleboard is suitable for experts and beginners alike. But can it really? 

At a push in my opinion it can actually support two adults at a time as the board is very stable. (One sitting and one standing).  

The hard wearing durable design means that you can take your dog with you and it should withstand the scratching from your dog's nails.

> In short if you prioritise comfort, sturdiness and stability then you will love this board!
