## Features

Stable & Maneuverable: It's easy to stand up and balance on a Drift paddle board! At 10'8" x 33" x 6", the wide deck and performance shape make for fast, fun paddling for all skill levels.

Inflatable & Portable: Quickly inflates or deflates for Easy Storage - packing down to just 38" x 18" x 12" and 19 lbs. Whether you’re jetting off to explore a tropical paradise or hiking into the wild to find that perfectly serene fishing spot, Drift Inflatable SUPs travel comfortably in their high-quality carrying bag backpacks.

Highly Durable: We use a High Tech process to transform military-grade PVC into a rock-solid rigid platform. With a core of composite drop-stitch fibers connected to the nearly indestructible outer skin, Drift boards stand up to anything you want to do on the water.

Complete Paddleboard Kit: Comes with all essential paddle board accessories, including coiled leash, removable fin, repair kit, 3-piece aluminum paddle, paddle board pump, and backpack carrying bag. Board Features include EVA foam deck pad, bungee straps, grab handles, 250 lb capacity, and our signature Entry Rocker style hull that sheds water and keeps the board nose up.

Better After Service: Based in Destin, Florida - we stand by the quality of our boards. All Drift paddle boards are covered by a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty at no additional cost. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or issues!
