This model features an extra-wide design that’s inspired by the scenic tropical beach style to represent the love for water sports and enjoyable life. The board comes with a fully functioning 2-way inflation system that includes a double-action air pump for inflating and deflating it. It’s good to note that the manufacturer has been considerate enough to label things out for the complete newbies.

The best thing is that the model can easily be stretched to standard air pressure in not more than 5 minutes.

Carrying and transporting large paddleboards has always been a key challenge even for the most veteran paddlers around.

To complement its extra-wide deck, this model also features a 6-point front bungee to provide paddlers with the means to secure and access your gear or extra cargo. For those who are interested in using it for fun racing, the board comes with two permanently fitted small fins and a removable large fin for extra paddling speed.
