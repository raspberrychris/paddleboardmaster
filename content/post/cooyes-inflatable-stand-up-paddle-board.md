What’s its Measurement?

If you’re no stranger to our blog and review sections, you probably know how important board measurements are in your paddleboard search. For those who don’t, measurement generally gives you a rough picture of what to expect.

Depending on your paddling needs, you can quickly disregard a huge chunk on your list by simply checking on their size. Consider it as the main physical metric to use in your buying criteria.

As for Cooyes Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board, it generally has a surface area of 10.6_32_6 inches. With such a dimension, you can already tell that it’s an extra-wide paddleboard even though getting one with 11 inches would have been better.

Before you dismiss buying it because it’s 10.6-inch length, you should note that its deck width is extra spacious and you can comfortably paddle with your pet, kid, or carry a light cargo with you. This extra wideness is particularly good because it generally adds to the board’s overall stability, meaning that the Cooyes Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board provides the perfect balance in the water.

In addition, this model is 6 inches thick across the board to assure you that everything will stay afloat once you get on the water. The only caution is that you have to make sure that you don’t exceed its maximum load capacity of 330 pounds, or you would run the risk of drowning/falling off.

What’s Its Quality?

In terms of quality, the Cooyes Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board is largely made of premium quality material. Its basic construction features the use of high-quality military-grade fabric that’s well done for premium paddling.

It has a strong build and you wouldn’t have to worry about it getting scratched or being damaged. Its build material is highly durable and you can expect it to last for a very long time without any quality issues.

What Features Does It Have?

From our findings, we can conclusively state that the Cooyes Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board is truly packed with great value features. Wait, you don’t believe me?

Here’s a detailed summary of the Cooyes Inflatable Stand up Paddle Board features:

This model features an extra-wide design that’s inspired by the scenic tropical beach style to represent the love for water sports and enjoyable life. The board comes with a fully functioning 2-way inflation system that includes a double-action air pump for inflating and deflating it. It’s good to note that the manufacturer has been considerate enough to label things out for the complete newbies.

The best thing is that the model can easily be stretched to standard air pressure in not more than 5 minutes.

Carrying and transporting large paddleboards has always been a key challenge even for the most veteran paddlers around. Like many other modern inflatable SUPs, this model comes with a complete easy to assemble design meaning that it can easily be transported around either using the provided backpack or the inbuilt carry handles.

I personally like how its rounded neoprene padded handle easily adapts to your grip for swift transportation.

For your general safety and comfort during paddling, the Cooyes Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board comes with an elastic safety rope to latch on, soft high-quality fabric that feels good on the skin, a 6-foot coiled ankle cuff leash, and a rear leash plug to safely secure yourself to the board after wearing the leash on your ankle to prevent you and your board from separating in the event that you fall into the water.

To complement its extra-wide deck, this model also features a 6-point front bungee to provide paddlers with the means to secure and access your gear or extra cargo. For those who are interested in using it for fun racing, the board comes with two permanently fitted small fins and a removable large fin for extra paddling speed.

Luckily, you can quickly refer to the included guide whenever you get stuck.

What’s Its General Performance?

By now, you can quickly tell that the Cooyes Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board is primarily built for outdoor water sporting activities with family and friends. The extra wideness provides you with more space to safely carry your kid or pet to your paddling adventures.

The three bottom panel fins are good for those who are looking for an extra kick during paddling. Apart from being generally sturdy and stable in the water, this model’s performance is perfect for all paddling skill levels.

In case you’re worried about falling off, simply don’t because it comes with an EVA foam deck pad and bungee strap handles to keep you glued to the board even when white water rafting. For easy steering, you will find its adjustable 3-piece aluminum paddle very convenient and easy to use.

Just keep in mind that the paddle can only float for a few minutes in case you drop yours. Otherwise, the Cooyes Inflatable Stand Up Paddle Board is also good for all kinds of water exploration including the search for a quiet fishing spot.
