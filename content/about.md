**[Paddle Board Master](/)** was started by Chris who first experienced paddle boarding while on holiday in San Diego and visiting La Jolla Cove.

Since then I have been hooked on Paddle Boarding and want to share my tips and tricks for paddle boarding with the wider world!

Paddle Boarding is one of the best hobbies that you can take up and it really gives you a chance to see the world around you in a completely different way to other water sports.

I hope you enjoy the site!

**Paddle Board Master!**
